\chapter{NUMBERS AND NUMERALS}
\label{ch:numbers-numerals}

\section{Introduction}

Many, perhaps most, of us take for granted the brilliant notations
that have been developed for the myriad arithmetic constructs that we
use daily.  Our mathematical ancestors have bequeathed us notations
that are not only perspicuous but also convenient for computing and
for discovering and verifying new mathematical truths.  Several
chapters in this text are devoted to sharing the elements of this
legacy with the reader.  This chapter focuses on elementary concepts
and techniques relating to the most familiar objects of mathematical
discourse, numbers and the numerals that we use to manipulate them.
We extend this chapter's introduction to our number system with more
advanced topics concerning numbers in
Chapter~\ref{ch:numbers-advanced}.

Every reader will be familiar with the notion of {\it number} and with
the familiar strings, called {\it numerals}, that name numbers.

Numbers and numerals embody what is certainly the most familiar
instance of a very important dichotomy that pervades our intellectual
lives: the distinction between objects and their names:

{\em Numbers are intangible, abstract objects.} \index{numbers!as objects}

{\em Numerals are the names we use to refer to and manipulate numbers.} 
\index{numerals!as names of numbers}

\noindent
This is a critically important distinction!  You can ``touch'' a
numeral: break it into pieces, combine two (or more) numerals via a
large range of operations.  When numerals are {\em operational},
\index{numerals!operational} then you can compute with them.  Numbers are
intangible abstractions, or, conceptualizations: you reason with
numbers.

\end{minipage}

\noindent
Historically, we have employed a broad range of mechanisms for naming
numbers.

{\ignore {\Arny I really like the idea of providing some cultural
    background to get the reader involved.}}
{\ignore {\Denis I also like the idea, may be we can shorten the Latin numbers
  and let some parts (examples) as an exercice...}}
{\ignore {\Arny Please propose what to omit.  I do want to point out the
  ``three levels'' of names/numerals: names that convey information
  only by cultural agreement; names that permit identification but no
  practical manipulation; {\em operational} names}}
\ignore{I am not sure, however, how much space to
  allocate.  For instance, I like the mention of Roman numerals and of
  the system that the Phoenicians used --- which I am familiar with
  mainly because of Hebrew --- but I am reluctant to go so far as to
  really discuss the formation rules of Roman numerals or the details
  of numeral formation in Hebrew and its kindred languages.}

\noindent
{\it Nicknames for ``popular'' numbers}.
%
At one extreme, we have endowed certain numbers that we are ``fond
of'' with names that do not even hint at the ``meaning of'' the named
number.  To cite just a few examples, we talk about
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\pi$: the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter
\item
$e$: the base of so-called natural logarithms
\item
$\phi$: the {\it golden ratio} (one of several word-names for $\phi$)
  that can be observed in nature, e.g., in the leaf patterns of plants
  such as pineapples and cauliflower
{\ignore  {\Denis we will develop some Maths involving $\phi$  in the chapter
    recurrences and Fibonacci numbers...}}
{\ignore {\Arny That is great!!  I just added a mention of that below!}}
\item
Avogadro's number: a fundamental quantity discussed in chemistry and
physics.  We include this number-name to indicate that not all
special numbers' nicknames are single letters.
\end{itemize}
Nickname-based numerals give no information about the named number:
they do not help anyone (except possibly the {\it cognoscenti:} the
``in-crowd'') {\em identify} the named number, and they do not help
anyone manipulate---e.g., compute with---the named number.  These
names are valuable only for {\em cultural} purposes, not mathematical
ones.

We want to be totally clear about our intended message.  It is the
{\em names} of the numbers we have mentioned that convey no
operational information.  Regarding the numbers themselves, each is
attached to valuable science and/or mathematics!  We shall expose some
of this mathematics as we discuss $e$ in the current chapter, as we
revisit $\pi$ and $e$ in Chapter~\ref{ch:Summation}, and as we revisit
$\phi$ in Chapter~\ref{ch:Recurrences}.

\medskip

\noindent
{\it Alphabet-based systems.}
%
Several cultures have developed systems for naming arbitrary integers
by using their alphabets in some manner.  One such system that is
still visible in European cultures within constrained contexts
comprises {\it Roman numerals}. \index{numerals!Roman} One stills
encounters these, e.g., as the hour markers on the faces of
``classical'' clocks and as timestamps on the cornerstones of official
buildings.  Roman numerals are formed from a constrained set of
letters from the Latin alphabet:

\begin{tabular}{c|c}
{\it Letter} & {\it Numerical value} \\
\hline
I  & 1 \\
V  & 5 \\
X  & 10 \\
L  & 50 \\
C  & 100 \\
D  & 500 \\
M  & 1000
\end{tabular}

\noindent
The formation rules for Roman numerals of length exceeding $2$ are a
bit complicated, but {\em roughly}, a letter to the right of a higher
valued letter augments the value of the numeral (e.g., DCL $=650$, XVI
$=16$), while a letter to the left of a higher valued letter lowers
the value (e.g., MCM $=1900$, XLIV $=44$).

Yet another way to craft numerals from letters is observable in the
based on, e.g., the Hebrew alphabet; \index{numerals!Hebrew} this
system assimilates ideas used by the ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians,
and Greeks.  Hebrew assigns the following respective values to the
$22$ letters of its alphabet.
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100,
 200, 300, 400
\]
Numerals are then formed as strings of single occurrences of letters,
by accumulating the letters' numerical values.  Numbers that are too
large to be named using strings of single letter-instances often allow
repeated letter instances or incorporate auxiliary words, in a
mixed-mode manner similar to our writing the number $5000$ as ``$5$
thousand''.  

{\ignore {\Denis I am not familiar with Hebrew, I would like to know
    how to address the unicity of the writing numbers...}}  {\ignore
{\Arny I am familiar with Hebrew numerals in only two contexts:

(a) They are used widely with the (Hebrew) calendar.  The names of the
  Hebrew months are Babylonian in origin.  The days are always
  denoted by Hebraic numerals.  Within a religious framework, there is
  a number that is associated with the age of the world (since
  ``creation'').  This number was computed by a Catholic monk many
  centuries ago, based on his reading of the Old Testament.  The Jews
  have adopted this number --- and they usually express it with a
  ``mixed'' Hebraic numeral of the form ``5 thousands plus abcd''.  In
  a semi-religious context such as a gravestone, e.g., all of the
  relevant numerals are denoted by Hebraic numerals.

(b) They are used widely as part of a semi-mystical exercise called
  ``gematria''.  Since every numeral is potentially a word, certain
  numbers gain semi-mystical importance.  The mystics use this a lot
  in interpreting biblical texts.  Perhaps the most POPULAR instance
  of gematria relates to the Hebrew word for ``life'': this two-letter
  word is ``chai''.  It has the numerical value 18.  Even nonreligious
  Jews will acknowledge this by, e.g., giving gifts that are integer
  multiples of 18.  For instance, a gift in the amount of 50 dollars is
  usually ``rounded up'' to 54.

I BELIEVE that the numerals were once used more widely, but I know
little about that.}}

Alphabet-based systems for creating numerals are more useful than
nickname-based systems: they {\em do} allow anyone to {\em identify}
any named number. Indeed, one can (algorithmically) convert any Roman
numeral or any Hebrew numeral to a decimal numeral for the same
number.  However, any reader who is familiar with alphabet-based
systems will recognize a major drawback of such systems: It is {\em
  exceedingly difficult} to do any but the most trivial arithmetic
using such systems' numerals.  Two simple examples using Roman
numerals will make our case:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Square CC.  This is, of course, trivial using our familiar decimal
numerals: an elementary school student can compute $200 \times 200 \ =
\ 40,000$.  But even in an early course on programming, one would not
assign the general ``multiply numbers using Roman numerals'' problem
as a first assignment.

\item
Substract MCMXCVIII from MMII.  We all know, of course, that the answer
is IV, but determining this is usually done by converting to decimal numerals
($2002-1998$).
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\it Positional number systems.}
%
In our daily commerce, we typically deal with numerals that are formed
within a {\it base-$b$ positional number system,}
\index{numerals in a (base-$b$) positional number system}
%
i.e., by strings of {\it digits} from a set of the form $\{0, 1, 2,
\ldots, \overline{b-1}\}$, often embellished with other symbols, such as
a {\em radix point},\footnote{The use of a period as the radix point
  is a US convention; in much of Europe, a comma usually denotes the
  radix point.}~and sometimes a leading ``$+$'' or ``$-$'' to
indicate, respectively, the denoted number's positivity or negativity.
\medskip

\noindent \fbox{
\begin{minipage}{0.97\textwidth}
%\[ \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \]
We employ the notation ``$\overline{b-1}$'' to remind ourselves that
in this context ``$b-1$'' is a digit~\index{digit}, not a string; for instance, when
$b = 10$ (the common {\em decimal} base), $\overline{b-1}$ is the
digit $9$.

\end{minipage}
}
%\[ \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \]
\medskip

\noindent
We discuss positional number systems in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:Numerals}.  For now, we settle for a few examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Most of our daily work employs the base-$10$ ({\it decimal}) system,
whose digits comprise the set $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5., 6, 7, 8, 9\}$; the
system's radix point is usually called a {\em decimal point}.

\item
Because electrical and electronic circuitry are (for the most part)
built using {\it bistable} devices---e.g., switches that are either
{\em on} or {\em off}---the system most often employed when dealing
with such circuitry and its end products (say, computers) is the
base-$2$ ({\it binary}) system, whose digits---usually called {\it
  bits}---comprise the set $\{0, 1\}$.
  The term bit is the contraction of binary digit. 

\item
Because of its small repertoire of digits, the binary system's
numerals are quite long---roughly $3$ times longer than decimal
numerals.  For instance,
\[ 32,768 \ \mbox{ base $10$} \ \ = \ 1,000,000,000,000,000 \ \mbox{
  base $2$}
\]
In order to make these numerals easier for humans to deal with, small
sequences of bits are often aggregated to form larger number bases---but
still powers of $2$.  Two aggregations have been particularly popular:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
By aggregating length-$3$ sequences of bits, one converts binary
numerals to base-$8$ ({\it octal}) numerals; the octal digits comprise
the set $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$.
  \item
By aggregating length-$4$ sequences of bits, one converts binary
numerals to base-$16$ ({\it hexadecimal}) numerals; the hexadecimal
digits comprise the set
\[ \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, \overline{10}, \overline{11},
\overline{12}, \overline{13}, \overline{14}, \overline{15}\}.
\]
{\it Note:} We have written the hexadecimal digits in decimal, to make
them easy to read, but we have placed overlines above the $2$-digit
(decimal) numerals ``$10$'', ``$11$'', ``$12$'', ``$13$'', ``$14$'',
and ``$15$'' as a reminder that each represents a single hexadecimal
digit, not a $2$-digit numeral.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{A Brief Biography of Our Number System}
\label{sec:number-taxonomy}
\index{number system!biography}
\label{sec:numbers}

We begin our study of numbers and numerals with a short taxonomy of
our number system.  Although we assume that the reader is familiar
with the most common classes of numbers, we do spend some time
highlighting important features of each class, partly, at least, in
the hope of heightening the reader's interest in this most basic
object of mathematical discourse.

We present the four most common classes of numbers in what is almost
certainly the chronological order of their discovery/invention.
\medskip

\noindent \fbox{
\begin{minipage}{0.96\textwidth}
%\[ \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \]
Did humans {\em invent} these classes of numbers to fill specific
needs, or did we just {\em discover} their pre-existing selves as
needs prompted us to search for them?  The great German mathematician
Leopold Kronecker, \index{Kronecker, Leopold}
as cited in \cite{Bell86} (page 477), shared his viewpoint on this
question: ``God made the integers; all else is the work of man.''
%\[ \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \]
\end{minipage}
}
\medskip

\noindent
A pleasing narrative can be fabricated to account for our multi-class
system of numbers.  In the beginning, the story goes, we needed to
count things (sheep, bottles of oil, weapons, \ldots), and the
positive {\it integers}\index{number!integer} were discovered to serve
this need.  As accounting practices matured, we needed to augment this
class with the number zero \index{number!zero ($0$)} ($0$), to allow
merchant $A$ to keep track of the inventory remaining after the last
flask of wine is sold, and with the negative integers,
\index{number!negative} to allow the merchant's banker to record $A$'s
credit balance after taking a loan.
%
{\ignore {\Denis right, nicely said, but the zero wasn't mainly
    created for the sake of computing idle positions in additions?} }
{\ignore {\Arny I was aiming for a history of NUMBERS, not numerals.
    There is no numeral for 0 in Latin or Hebrew, but there were
    certainly word-names for zero.  I believe that the numeral is not
    needed until you have a positional number system.}}  
%
The class of integers was now complete, even though a variety of
special classes of integers that warranted special attention for
reasons ranging from the religious to the intellectual remained to be
discovered.  As society matured, humans began to share materials that
had to be subdivided---cloth, grain, etc.---rather than partitioned in
discrete units.  We needed to invent the {\it rational numbers}
\index{number!rational} to deal with such materials.  Happily for the
mathematically inclined, the rational numbers could be developed in a
way that allowed one to view an integer as a special type of rational.
This meant that our ancestors could build upon the systems they had
developed to deal with integers, rather than scrapping those systems
and starting anew.
\medskip

\noindent \fbox{
\begin{minipage}{0.97\textwidth}
%\[ \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \]
This quest for {\em extendible} frameworks rather than isolated
  unrelated frameworks is a hallmark of mathematical thinking.
%\[ \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \]
\end{minipage}
}
\medskip

\noindent
We now enter the realm of ``semi-recorded'' history in the West: the
Babylonians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, and others.  ``Practical''
mathematics was invented---and reinvented---to accommodate pursuits as
varied as astronomy, commerce, navigation and architecture. Our mathematical stalwarts, the
integers and the rationals, did not seem to be able to deal with all
of the measurements that we wanted to make, calculations that we
wanted to do, structures that we wanted to design.  So, we
approximated and ``fudged'' and got pretty much where we wanted to
get.  The standard story at this point (at least in the West) is that
the ancient Greeks began to try to systematize mathematical knowledge
and practice.  The Greek mathematician and geometer Euclid
\index{Euclid} and members of his school verified---via one of the
first {\em proofs} in recorded history---the uncomfortable fact that
the lengths of portions of eminently buildable structures were not
``measurable,'' by which they meant {\em not rational}.  The poster
child for this phenomenon was the hypotenuse of the isosceles right
triangle $T$ with unit-length legs.  Thanks to the well-known theorem
of the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, \index{Pythagoras} even
schoolchildren nowadays know that the length of this eminently
buildable line is $\sqrt{2}$.  What Euclid discovered---and what is
still likely not known by {\em all} schoolchildren---is: {\em There
  is---provably!---no way to find integers $p$ and $q$ whose ratio is
  $\sqrt{2}$, the length of $T$'s hypotenuse.}\footnote{We present a
  version of Euclid's proof in Proposition~\ref{thm:sqrt(2)}.}
\bigskip

\noindent \textbf{Digression}

%\[ \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \]
It is worthwhile digressing here with some supplementary material so
that you do not have to take our word for the mathematical facts
underlying our story.

Even though the so-called {\it Pythagorean Theorem} is widely known,
at least informally, it is worthwhile to provide a formal statement of
this seminal result.  Quite aside from reviewing the Theorem's
important content, this statement will provide the reader one more
opportunity to ponder the ``music'' of mathematical discourse.

Let us be given a triangle $T$ with vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$.
\index{triangle} Use the lefthand grey triangle in
Fig.~\ref{fig:unitsquare} as a model.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{FiguresArithmetic/UnitSquareSQRT2}
\caption{A pictorial schematic proof of The Pythagorian Theorem for
  the special case of an isosceles right triangle.
\label{fig:unitsquare}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
\ignore{\Arny Please edit the figure to follow this story ... label the
  vertices of triangle $T$.  Any other labels? ... hypotenuse?  }
%
Say that the angle at vertex $A$ of $T$ is a {\em right angle},
\index{right angle} i.e., that its measure is $90^\circ$ \index{right
  angle!$90^\circ$} \index{right angle!$90$ degrees} \index{right
  angle!$\pi/2$ radians} ($90$ degrees or, equivalently, $\pi/2$
radians).  In this case, we say that $T$ is a {\em right
  triangle}. \index{triangle!right triangle} Because $T$ is a right
triangle, the line from vertex $A$ to vertex $B$ and the line from
vertex $A$ to vertex $C$ are called the {\em sides}
\index{triangle!right triangle!side} \index{triangle!right
  triangle!leg} (or the {\it legs}) of $T$, while the line from vertex
$B$ to vertex $C$ is called the {\em hypotenuse} \index{triangle!right
  triangle!hypotenuse} of $T$.  Triangle $T$ is {\em isosceles}
\index{triangle!isosceles triangle} precisely when its two sides have
the same length.  The grey triangle in Fig.~\ref{fig:unitsquare} is an
isosceles right triangle.

\begin{theorem}[{\bf The Pythagorean Theorem}]
\label{thm:Pythagorean-thm}
Let $T$ be a right triangle whose two sides have respective lengths
$s_1$ and $s_2$, and whose hypotenuse has length $h$.  Then
\[ h^2 \ = \ s_1^2 + s_2^2. \]
Consequently, when $T$ is an {\em isosceles} right triangle, then $h^2
= 2 s_1^2$.
\end{theorem}

\ignore{\Denis I put here a figure for proving the result, may be it
  is not at the right place, feel free to put it elsewhere... I
  developed later a graphical proof of the theorem...}

The special case of the Pythagorean Theorem, which deals with
isosceles right triangles admits the very perspicuous proof presented
pictorially in Fig.~\ref{fig:unitsquare}.  Let us review this proof.

We begin with the unit-side square $S$ on the left of the figure.  We
partition $S$ by its diagonal into two unit-side isosceles right
triangles, one grey and one white.  In this construction the diagonal
of $S$ is the (common) hypotenuse of the two triangles.  On the
righthand side of Fig.~\ref{fig:unitsquare}, we use our partitioned
version of $S$ to construct a new, bigger square, call it
$\widehat{S}$, whose side-length is the hypotenuse-length of the grey
triangle.  The dotted lines in the figure tell us how big
$\widehat{S}$ is (measured in area).
\begin{itemize}
\item
Square $S$ is unit-sided, hence has unit area.
\item
The grey triangle is (geometrically) half of $S$, hence has area
$1/2$.
\item
Square $\widehat{S}$ is built from four copies of the grey
triangle, hence has area $4 \cdot 1/2 \ = \ 2$.
\end{itemize}
Because the hypotenuse of the grey triangle is a side of an area-$2$
square, we have just proved the following special case of the
Pythagorean Theorem.

{\em The hypotenuse of the unit-side isosceles right triangle has length $\sqrt{2}$.}

As part of the same movement toward formal mathematics, the
Sicilian-based Greek mathematician and polymath Archimedes \index{Archimedes}
was systematically observing that squares are better approximations to
circles than triangles are; regular pentagons are better than squares;
regular hexagons are better than pentagons; and so on.  
Fig.~\ref{fig:approxcircle} illustrates this evidence.
%
\ignore{\Denis I added a figure here, feel free to remove it if you
  believe it is not appropriate. I can also extend the figure with
  higher degree polygons....} 
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{FiguresArithmetic/ApproxCircle}
\caption{{\it Octagons approximate circles much better than squares do.}
\label{fig:approxcircle}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
In fact, observed Archimedes, as the number of sides, $n$, in a
regular polygon grows without bound (or, as we might say today, tends
to infinity), each increase in $n$ brings a regular polygon closer to
being a circle.

In order to pursue their respective observations to their completion,
both Euclid and Archimedes would have to leave the world of the
rationals and enter the world of the {\it real numbers}
\index{number!real}
(so named by the French mathematician-philosopher Ren\'{e} Descartes).
\index{Descartes, Ren\'{e}}
It would take roughly two-thousand years from the time of Euclid and
Archimedes before the real numbers were {\em formally} introduced to
the world, by mathematical luminaries such as the early-19th-century
French mathematician-scientist Augustin-Louis Cauchy
\index{Cauchy, Augustin-Louis}
and the late-19th-century German mathematician Richard Dedekind.
\index{Dedekind, Richard}
It turned out to be much easier to recognize instances of non-rational
real numbers than to formally delimit the entire family of such
numbers.  Once again, happily, one could develop the real numbers in a
way that allowed one to view a rational number as a special type of
real number.  

During the millennia between the discoveries of Euclid, Archimedes, and
their friends and the full development of the real numbers,
mathematics was enriched repeatedly by the discovery of new conceptual
structures.  One of these---polynomials
\index{polynomial}
and their
\index{polynomial!root}
%
roots---ultimately led to the final major subsystem of our number
system.  In Chapter~\ref{sec:function}, we discussed the important
notion of {\em function}.  Polynomials \index{polynomial} are a
practically important class of functions that are delimited by the
operations needed to compute them.  Specifically, an $n$-argument
polynomial function---typically just called a polynomial---is a
function $P(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ whose values can be calculated
using just the basic operations of arithmetic: addition/subtraction
and multiplication/division.\footnote{We pair the operations in this
  way because addition and subtraction are {\em mutually inverse
    operations}, \index{mutually inverse operations} as are
  multiplication and division.  This means that one can undo an
  operation (say, an addition) by performing its inverse operation (in
  this case, a subtraction).  But {\em be careful:} one cannot undo
  multiplication by $0$.}  A {\it root} \index{polynomial!root} of a
polynomial (function) $P(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ is an argument
$\langle r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n \rangle$ that causes $P$ to {\it
  vanish}, meaning that $P(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n) = 0$.  Here are a
few illustrative, examples of {\em univariate} (i.e., {\em
  single-variable}) polynomials: \index{polynomial!univariate}
\index{polynomial!single-variable}

\smallskip

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & Polynomial $P(x)$ & Root(s) \\
\hline
1 &
$x+1$  &  $x= -1$ \\
2 &
$x-1$  &  $x= 1$ \\
3 &
$x^2 + 2x +1 = (x+1)^2$ & $x = -1$ \\ 
4 &
$x^2 - 2x +1 = (x-1)^2$ & $x = 1$ \\ 
5 &
$x^2 - 1$ & $x = 1$ and $x= -1$ \\
6 &
$x^2 + 1$ & {\em no real root} \\
7 &
$x^2 -2$  & $x = \sqrt{2}$ and $x = - \sqrt{2}$ \\
8 &
$x^2 + 2$ & {\em no real root} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\smallskip

\noindent
There are lessons, both major and minor, to be gleaned from this table.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Entries 3 and 4 in the table illustrate that even simple polynomials
can often be written in several different ways.  These entries
illustrate also that roots can occur {\em with multiplicity:}
\index{polynomial!root!multiplicity} one can view the value $x = -1$
as causing the polynomial $x^2 + 2x +1 = (x+1)\cdot (x+1)$ to vanish
in two ways---(1) by setting the lefthand factor $x+1$ to $0$ and
(2) by setting the righthand factor $x+1$ to $0$.

\item
Entries 5 and 7 in the table illustrate that polynomials can have
multiple distinct roots.

\item
Perhaps most importantly, entries 6 and 8 in the table provide
explicit, simple polynomials---whose expressions involve only positive
integers---that fail to have any real roots!

The fact that the indicated polynomials have no real roots is
immediate, because the square of a real number can never be negative.
Hence, for instance, there is no positive integer $c$ such that $c^2 =
-1$, or, equivalently, $c^2 + 1 = 0$.
\end{itemize}

\smallskip

For both applied and purely intellectual reasons, there has always
been considerable interest in developing techniques for finding the
roots of polynomials.  Indeed, much seminal mathematics was developed
in the quest for such techniques;\footnote{A giant in the development
  and transmission of this work was the $9$th-century mathematician
  and astronomer whose name is traditionally anglicized as Muhammad
  ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi \index{al-Khwarizmi, Muhammad}.  He is usually
  credited with introducing Hindu-Arabic numerals (ancestors of the
  ones we use to this day) and the elements of algebra into Europe.
  And, he is the eponym of our word ``{\em algorithm}''.}~ we study
the topic at length in Section~\ref{sec:polynomials}.

Closely related to this interest in a polynomial's roots was the
considerable discomfort within the mathematical and technical world at
the fact that the then-current number system---built upon the
integers, the rationals, and the reals---was inadequate to the
important task of providing roots for every polynomial.  The reaction
to this deficiency was similar in kind to all earlier recognized
deficiencies: a way was found to expand the number system!  Centuries
would pass before mathematics developed adequately to find the needed
expansion.  Once discovered, the expansion was based in the
conception, in the $16$th century, of a new {\it imaginary} number,
\index{number!imaginary} so designated by \index{Descartes, Ren\'{e}}
Descartes.\footnote{The term ``imaginary'' is reputed to be a
  derogation of these numbers that flouted tradition.}  This new
number was named $i$ \index{imaginary number $i = \sqrt{-1}$}
\index{$i$: the imaginary unit} (for ``imaginary'') and was defined to
be a root of the polynomial $P_{-1}(x) = x^2 +1$.  The number $i$ was
evocatively often defined via the equation, $i = \sqrt{-1}$.  By
keeping our extended arithmetic consistent with our former arithmetic,
$-i$ also became a root of $P_{-1}(x)$.  When the imaginary number $i$
was added to the real number system, and the combination was blended
via the rules of arithmetic, the {\it complex number
  system}\index{number!complex} was born.

Thankfully, the imaginary number $i$ was the only totally new concept
that was needed to mend the observed deficiency in the real numbers.
In formal terms, the complex numbers were shown to be {\it
  algebraically complete} \index{complex numbers!algebraically
  complete} in the sense expressed in the landmark {\it Fundamental
  Theorem of Algebra}: \index{Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}

\begin{theorem}[{\bf The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}]
Every polynomial of degree $n$ with complex coefficients has $n$ roots
over the complex numbers.
\end{theorem}

The proof of the Theorem is beyond the scope of our introductory text,
but the result is a notable milestone in our mathematical/technical
culture.

Our historical tour is now complete, so we can---finally---begin to
get acquainted with our number system and the operations that bring it
to life in applications.

\section{Integers: The ``Whole'' Numbers}
\label{sec:integers}

The most basic class of numbers are the {\it integers},
\index{number!integer}
which are also referred to as the {\it whole numbers}
\index{number!integer!whole number}
or the {\em counting numbers}.
\index{number!integer!counting number}
%
As suggested in our ``biography'' of our number system
(Section~\ref{sec:number-taxonomy}), integers are certainly the
numbers that our prehistoric ancestors employed in the earliest days
of our species.  This section is devoted to exploring some of the
basic properties of the class of integers.  The details we provide in
Section~\ref{sec:primes} regarding the building blocks of the
integers, the {\it prime numbers}, \index{number!prime} will prepare
the reader for myriad applications of the integers, including
important security-related applications.  Our introduction to {\it
  pairing functions}, \index{pairing functions} in
Section~\ref{sec:pairing}, will open the door toward myriad
applications of the integers that build on the ordering properties of
the integers, coupled with tools for encoding highly structured data
as integers.  We begin to explore the basics of the integers.

\subsection{The Basics of the Integers: The Number Line}
\label{sec:integer-number-line}
\index{number!the number line}
\index{number!integer!the number line}

We survey a number of the most important properties of the following
three sets, which collectively comprise ``the integers.''
\begin{itemize}
\item
The set $\Z$
\index{$\Z$: the set of all integers}
comprises {\em all integers}---the positive and negative integers and
zero ($0$).
\item
The set $\N$
\index{$\N$: the set of nonnegative integers}
comprises the {\em nonnegative integers}---the positive integers and
zero ($0$).
\item
The set $\N^+$
\index{$\N^+$: the set of positive integers}
comprises the {\em positive integers}.
\end{itemize}
There is no universal default when one refers to ``the integers'' with
no qualifying adjective; therefore, we shall always be careful to
indicate which set we are discussing at any moment---often by
supplying the set-name: $\Z$ or $\N$ or $\N^+$.

\subsubsection{Natural orderings of the integers}
\label{sec:natural-orderings}

Several essential properties of the sets $\Z$, $\N$, and $\N^+$ are
consequences of the integers' behaviors under their natural order
relations:
\begin{itemize}
\item
the two {\em less-than} relations:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
the {\em strict} relation ($<$).  We articulate ``$a < b$'' as ``$a$
is (strictly) less than $b$'' or ``$a$ is (strictly) smaller than
$b$.''
  \item
the {\em nonstrict} relation ($\leq$).  We articulate ``$a \leq b$''
as ``$a$ is less than or equal to $b$'' or ``$a$ is no larger than
$b$.''
  \end{itemize}
\index{$<$: the strict less-than relation} \index{$\leq$: the nonstrict less-than relation}

\item
their {\em converses,} the {\em greater-than} relations:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
the {\em strict} relation ($>$).  We articulate ``$a > b$'' as ``$a$
is (strictly) larger than $b$.''
  \item
the {\em nonstrict} relation ($\geq$).  We articulate ``$a \geq b$''
as ``$a$ is greater than or equal to $b$'' or ``$a$ is no smaller than
$b$.''
  \end{itemize}
\index{$>$: the strict greater-than relation}
\index{$\geq$: the nonstrict greater-than relation}
\end{itemize}
One sometimes encounters {\em emphatic} versions of the strict
relations: $a << b$ and $a >> b$ indicate that $a$ is, respectively,
{\em much smaller than} or {\em much larger than} $b$.
\index{$<<$: the emphatic strict less-than relation}
\index{$>>$: the emphatic strict greater-than relation}

The reader will note throughout the text that order within a number
system is among one's biggest friends when reasoning about the numbers
within the system.  \index{number!ordering of numbers}

\subsubsection{The order-related laws of the integers}
\label{sec:order-laws}

\paragraph{\small\sf A. Total order and the Trichotomy Laws}

The sets $\Z$, $\N$, and $\N^+$ are {\em totally ordered},
\index{number!integer!total order}
\index{integer!total order}
also termed {\em linearly ordered}
\index{number!integer!linear ordering}
\index{integer!linear ordering}.
\smallskip

These facts are embodied in the {\em Trichotomy Laws for integers}.
\index{number!integer!Trichotomy Laws}
\index{integer!Trichotomy Laws}
\index{Trichotomy Laws}
\medskip

{\it The Trichotomy Laws for integers}.
\smallskip

(i)
%
{\it For each integer $a \in \Z$, precisely one of the following is true.}

\hspace*{.2in} $a$ equals $0$: $(a=0)$ \ \ \ \ \ \
 $a$ is {\em positive}: $(a>0)$ \ \ \ \ \ \
 $a$ is {\em negative}: $(a<0)$
\smallskip

(ii)
%
{\it For each integer $a \in \N$, precisely one of the following is true.}

\hspace*{.2in} $a$ equals $0$: $(a=0)$ \ \ \ \ \ \
 $a$ is {\em positive}: $(a>0)$
\smallskip

(iii)
%
{\it For each integer $a \in \N^+$:}

\hspace*{.2in} $a$ is {\em positive}: $(a>0)$
\bigskip

Consequently:
\smallskip

(i')
$\Z$ can be visualized via the ($2$-way infinite) number line:
\index{number!the number line}
\[ \ldots, -3, \  -2, \ -1, \ 0, \ 1,\  2, \ldots \]
\smallskip

(ii')
$\N$ can be visualized via the ($1$-way infinite) number line:
\[  0, \ 1, \ 2, \ 3, \ldots \]
\smallskip

(iii')
$\N^+$ can be visualized via the ($1$-way infinite) number line:
\[  1, \ 2, \ 3, \ldots \]
\bigskip

The Trichotomy Laws can be expressed using arbitrary pairs of integers,
rather than insisting that one of the integers be zero.  For the set
$\Z$, for instance, this version of the Laws takes the following form:

{\it For any integers $a, b \in \Z$, precisely one of the following is
  true.}

\hspace*{.2in} $a$ equals $b$: $(a=b)$ \ \ \ \ \ \
 $a$ is less than $b$: $(a<b)$ \ \ \ \ \ \
 $a$ is greater than $b$: $(a>b)$

line, whence the name of the law.

\subsection{Divisibility: Quotients, Remainders, Divisors}
\label{sec:divisibility}
\index{divisibility}
\index{integers!divisibility}

This section is devoted to studying the fundamental relation of {\em
  divisibility} between two integers.  Let $m, n \in \N$ be
nonnegative integers.  We use any of the following locutions to assert
the existence of a positive integer $q$ such that $n = q \cdot m$.
\index{number!integer!divisor}
\index{number!integer!divisibility}\index{$m \mid n$: $m$ divides $n$}
\begin{itemize}
\item
$m$ {\it divides} $n$
\item
$m$ {\it is a divisor of} $n$
\item
$n$ {\it is divisible by} $m$
\item
$m \mid n$.
\end{itemize}
This section is devoted to studying the possible {\it divisibility}
relations between integers $m$ and $n$.  We begin by noting some
general facts.
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\em Every integer $m$ divides $0$.}

This is because of the universal equations $m \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot m = 0$.  
The same equations verify that $0$ {\em does not divide any integer.}

\item
{\em $1$ divides every integer.}

This is because of the universal equation $1 \cdot m = m$.
\item
{\em Every nonzero integer divides itself.}

This is because of the universal equation $m \cdot 1 = m$.
\end{itemize}

Some nonzero integers have many distinct divisors, while some have
very few.  Consider, for illustration, the first twelve positive
integers.
\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\mbox{Number} & \mbox{Divisors} \\
\hline
\hline
1  &  \{ 1 \} \\
2  &  \{ 1, 2 \} \\
3  &  \{ 1, 3 \} \\
4  &  \{ 1, 2, 4 \} \\
5  &  \{ 1, 5 \} \\
6  &  \{ 1, 2, 3 \} \\
7  &  \{ 1, 7 \} \\
8  &  \{ 1, 2, 4, 8 \} \\
9  &  \{ 1, 3, 9 \} \\
10  & \{ 1, 2, 5, 10 \} \\
11  & \{ 1, 11 \} \\
12  & \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \} \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
All nonzero integers (but 1) have at least two divisors, $1$ and themselves.
The ``sparsely divisible'' integers that have only these two divisors
are called {\it primes}\index{numbers!integers!prime} or {\it prime
  integers} or {\it prime numbers}.  We study these ``building blocks
of the positive integers'' in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:primes}.
While there is, indeed, much of interest to discuss about prime
numbers, the \index{numbers!integers!composite} {\it composite}---or,
nonprime---integers are also quite interesting, particularly, when we
focus of {\em pairs} of integers.  The next section looks at the
defining property of composite integers, namely, {\em divisibility}.

\medskip

In order to better understand the fundamental concept of divisibility,
we must broaden our perspective somewhat and consider the notion of
{\em Euclidean division}, \index{Euclidean division} i.e., division
with remainders.  The notion of ``perfect'' divisibility that we have
been discussing thus far is the special case in which the remainder is
$0$.  The next subsection studies Euclidean division; the remainder of
this section investigates the ramifications of ``perfect''
divisibility.

\subsubsection{Euclidian division}
\label{sec:euclidian}
\index{Euclidean division}

Divisibility is not always perfect: Given a pair of integers, neither
needs be an integer multiple of the other.  As we learned in
elementary school, if an integer $m > 0$ does not ``evenly'' divide an
integer $n > m$, then we are left with a ``remainder'' when we attempt
to divide $n$ by $m$.  {it Euclidean} \index{Euclidean division} {\it
  division}---so named for the Greek mathematician Euclid,
\index{Euclid} whose writings introduced the process in the West---is
the process of producing, given integers $m >0$ and $n >m$, an integer
{\it quotient} \index{quotient} $q$ and an integer {\it remainder}
\index{remainder} $r$ (where $0 \leq r < m$) such that $n = q \cdot m
+ r$.  The process of Euclidean division always succeeds, in the
following strong sense.

\begin{prop}[The Division Theorem]
\label{thm:division-thm}
Given any integers $n$ and $m > 0$, there exists a unique pair of
integers $q$ and $r$, with $0 \leq r < m$ such that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:euclid-division}
n \ = \ q \cdot m + r.
\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
We first prove that a result-pair $\langle q, r \rangle$, as described
in the Proposition, exists for each argument-pair $\langle m, n
\rangle$.  Then we prove that the result-pair is unique.

\medskip

\noindent {\em There exists at least one argument-pair}.
%
Given any argument-pair $\langle m, n \rangle$, let $N_{m,n}$ be the
set of all integers of the form $(n - a \cdot m)$ for some
integer $a$.  Symbolically,
\[ N_{m,n} \ \eqdef \ \{ (n - a \cdot m) \ \ | \ \  \mbox{ both } \  a,  \
(n - a \cdot m) \in \N  \}
\]

Each such set $N_{m,n}$ is a nonempty set of nonnegative integers: the
nonemptiness follows because $n \in N_{m,n}$ (via the case $a=0$).  By
the Well-ordering law, $N_{m,n}$ contains a (perforce, unique) {\em
  smallest} element.  Let us denote this smallest element by $r$, and
let us denote by $a_r$ the value of $a$ that yields $r$; i.e.,
\[ n - a_r \cdot m \ = \ r.  \]
We complete this section of the proof, we need show that $r < m$.
Say, for contradiction, that $r = m+r'$ for some $r' \in \N^+$.  We
then find
\[ n - (a_r +1)  \cdot m \ = \ r -m \ = r' \]
to be an element of $N_{m,n}$ that is strictly smaller than $r$.  This
contradiction completes the first part of the proof.
\medskip

\noindent {\em 2. There exists at most one argument-pair}.
%
Turn now to the issue of uniqueness.  Say, for the sake of
contradiction, that there exists an argument-pair $\langle m, n
\rangle$, for which there exist distinct result-pairs $\langle q_1,
r_1 \rangle$ and $\langle q_2, r_2 \rangle$.  We therefore have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:euclid-unique}
n \ = \ q_1 \cdot m + r_1 \ = \ q_2 \cdot m + r_2,
\end{equation}
where both $r_1$ and $r_2$ satisfy the inequalities $0 \leq r_1, r_2
<m$.  We consider two cases.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case 1.}
Assume first that $r_2 = r_1$.  In this case, the equations
(\ref{eq:euclid-unique}) tell us that
\[ q_1 \cdot m \ = \ q_2 \cdot m. \]
The cancellation law for multiplication then tells us that $q_1 =
q_2$.  Therefore, the allegedly distinct result-pairs are, in fact,
identical.

\item \textbf{Case 2.}
If $r_2 \neq r_1$, then say, with no loss of generality, that $r_2 >
r_1$.  In this case, the equations (\ref{eq:euclid-unique}) tell us
that
\[ (q_1 - q_2) m \ = \ r_2 - r_1 . \]
Because the righthand quantity is positive, so also must be the
lefthand quantity; i.e., $q_1 > q_2$ because $r_2 > r_1$.

On the one hand, the lefthand quantity, $(q_1 - q_2) m$, is no smaller
than $m$.  This is because $q_1$ and $q_1 > q_2$ are integers.  On the
other hand, the lefthand quantity, $r_2 - r_1$ is strictly smaller
than $m$.  This is because $r_1 \geq 0$ so that $r_2 - r_1$ is no
larger than $r_2$.
\end{itemize}
Both of the relevant cases thus lead to contradictions, so we must
conclude that no argument-pair gives rise to more than one
result-pair.  \qed
\end{proof}


\subsubsection{Divisibility, divisors, {\sc gcd}s}
\label{sec:divisibility+GCD}

We begin to study the several important aspects of integer
divisibility by considering a variety of simple, yet significant,
consequences of an integer $n$'s being divisible by an integer $m$.
We leave the following applications of the basic definitions as
exercises for the reader.

\begin{prop}.
\label{thm:basic-divisibility}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
If $m$ divides $n$, then $m$ divides all integer multiples of $n$.
Symbolically: If $m$ divides $n$, then $m$ divides $cn$ for all
integers $c$.
\item
The relation ``divides'' is {\em transitive}; see
Chapter~\ref{sec:order-relation}.  Specifically, if [$m$ divides $n$],
and [$n$ divides $q$ for some integer $q$], then $n$ divides $q$.
\item
The relation ``divides'' distributes over addition.\footnote{We use
  the term ``distributes'' in the sense of the Distributive Law; see
  Chapter~\ref{sec:Arithmetic-Laws}.C.}  Specifically, if [$m$ divides
  $n$], and [$m$ divides $(n+q)$ for some integer $q$], then [$m$
  divides $q$].

Hint: $\displaystyle \frac{n+q}{m} \ = \ \frac{n}{m} + \frac{q}{m}$.
\item 
For any integer $c \neq 0$,
\[ \left[[m \mbox{ divides } n] \ \ \mbox{ if, and only if, } \ \ [cm
    \mbox{ divides } cn] \right]. \]
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

The following result follows from the preceding facts.

\begin{prop}
\label{thm:m-common-divisor-nq}
Given integers $m$, $n$, and $q$, if $m$ divides both $n$ and $q$,
then $m$ divides all linear combinations of $n$ and $q$; i.e.,
$m \mbox{ divides } (sn + tq)$ for all integers $s$ and $t$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Because $m$ divides both $n$ and $q$, there exist integers $k_1$ and
$k_2$ such that $k_1 \cdot m = n$ and $k_2 \cdot m = q$.  By the
distributive law, we therefore have:
\[ (k_1 \cdot s \ + \ k_2 \cdot t)m \ = \ sn+tq \]
for any $s$ and $t$.  \qed
\end{proof}

Among the common divisors of integers $n$ and $q$, a particularly
significant one is their {\em greatest common divisor},
\index{greatest common divisor}
which is the largest integer that divides both $n$ and
$q$.  We abbreviate ``greatest common divisor'' by
 {\sc gcd} \index{{\sc gcd}: greatest
  common divisor}, and we write
\[ m \ = \ \mbox{\sc gcd}(n, q) \]
to identify an integer $m$ as the {\sc gcd} of $n$ and $q$.

We are finally ready for our first major result about integer division
and divisors.

\begin{prop}[B\'{e}zout's identity]
\label{thm:gcd-n-linear}
For positive integers $n$ and $q$, {\sc gcd}$(n, q)$ is the smallest
positive linear combination of $n$ and $q$.
\index{B\'{e}zout, Etienne}

\noindent
Stated alternatively: For any positive integers $n$ and $q$, there
exist integers $s$ and $t$, not necessarily positive, such that
\[ sn + bq \ = \ \mbox{\sc gcd}(n, q). \]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Consider the set of all integer linear combinations of $n$ and $q$:
\[  L_{n,q} \ \eqdef \   \{ sn +tq \ | \ s, s \in \Z \} \ \subseteq \ \Z. \]
Note that both $n$ and $q$ belong to $L_{n,q}$, because of the
respective cases $(s=1, t=0)$ and $(s=0, t=1)$.  One consequence of
this is that $L_{n,q}$ has a nonempty subset, call it
$L^{(>0)}_{n,q}$, all of whose elements are {\em positive} integers.

By the {\it Well-Ordering law of the positive integers}, the set
$L^{(>0)}_{n,q}$ has a smallest element, call it $m_0$.  By definition
of $L^{(>0)}_{n,q}$, $m_0$ is a positive integer, and there exist
integers $s_0$ and $t_0$ such that
\[  m_0 \ = \ s_0 n + t_0 q. \]

We claim that $L^{(>0)}_{n,q}$ in fact {\em consists precisely of all
  positive-integer multiples of $m_0$.}  Were this not the case, there
would be an element $m$ of $L^{(>0)}_{n,q}$ that is not a
(positive-integer) multiple of $m_0$.  Let $m_1$ be the {\em smallest}
such element $m$.  We then have
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Because $m_1 \in L^{(>0)}_{n,q}$, there exist integers $s_1$ and $t_1$
such that
\[  m_1 \ = \ s_1 n + t_1 q. \]
\item
Because $m_0$ is the {\em smallest} element of $L^{(>0)}_{n,q}$, the
difference have $m_2 \ \eqdef \ m_1 - m_0$ must be positive, so that
$m_2 \ = \ (s_1 - s_0) n + (t_1 -t_0) q$ must belong to
$L^{(>0)}_{n,q}$.
\end{enumerate}
Now, we are in trouble because of the following incompatible facts.
\begin{itemize}
\item
On the one hand, $m_2$ {\em is not} a multiple of $m_0$

If it were a multiple, then we would have $m_0$ dividing both $m_0$
(trivially) and $m_2 = m_1 - m_0$.  But this would imply that $m_0$
divides $m_1$, contrary to assumption.

\item
On the other hand,
$m_2$ {\em is} a multiple of $m_0$

This is because $m_2 < m_1$, while $m_1$ is the {\em smallest} element
of $L^{(>0)}_{n,q}$ that is not a multiple of $m_0$.
\end{itemize}
This contradiction forces us to conclude that integer $m_1$ does not
exist; in other words: all elements of $L^{(>0)}_{n,q}$ are multiples
of $m_0$.

Let us summarize.  The set of positive integer linear combinations of
$n$ and $q$ consists entirely of integer multiples of a single integer
$m_0$.  This means, in particular, that $m_0$ is a common divisor
of $n$ and $q$.  The only way this situation could hold is if
$m_0 = \mbox{\sc gcd}(n,q)$, as claimed in the proposition.  \qed
\end{proof}

B\'{e}zout's identity has the following significant corollary.

\begin{corol}
Every linear combination of $n$ and $q$ is a multiple of $\mbox{\sc
  gcd}(n,q)$, and vice-versa.
\end{corol}

Greatest common divisors are fundamental companions of pairs of
integers, with manifold computational applications.  How does one
compute them?  This question was addressed millennia ago, by Euclid,
\index{Euclid} who authored the following result, which led to the
{\sc gcd}-computing algorithm that bears his name.\index{the Euclidean Algorithm}

For any integers $n$ and $m > 0$, let $\mbox{\sc rem}(m,n)$ denote the
remainder in the Euclidean division expression (\ref{eq:euclid-division})
for $m$ and $n$; i.e.,
\[ n \ = \ q \cdot m \ + \ \mbox{\sc rem}(m,n). \]

Notice here that we use an integer function to express the reminder
since it will be used as the result of an operation on two integers (similarly to what we did for the GCD).

\begin{prop}
\label{thm:gcd-basis}
For any integers $n$ and $m > 0$,
\[ \mbox{\sc gcd}(m,n) \ = \  \mbox{\sc gcd}(m, \ \mbox{\sc rem}(m,n)) . \]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
For integers $x > 0$ and $y \geq 0$, we denote by $D(x,y)$ the set of
common divisors of $x$ and $y$, i.e., the set of integers that divide
both $x$ and $y$.  We prove the proposition by showing, as follows,
that the sets $D(m, n)$ and $D(m, \mbox{\sc rem})$ actually contain
precisely the same elements.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
$D(m, n) \ \subseteq \ D(m, \mbox{\sc rem}(m,n))$.

Say that the integer $d$ divides both $m$ and $n$, i.e., that $d \in
D(m,n)$.  By Proposition~\ref{thm:division-thm}, we know that $n \ =
\ q \cdot m \ + \ \mbox{\sc rem}(m,n)$.  By property 3 in
Proposition~\ref{thm:basic-divisibility}, we must then have $d \mid
\mbox{\sc rem}(m,n)$.  This means that $d \in D(m, \mbox{\sc rem}(m,n))$.

\item 
$D(m, \mbox{\sc rem}(m,n)) \ \subseteq \ D(m,n)$.

Say that the integer $d$ divides both $m$ and $\mbox{\sc rem}(m,n)$,
i.e., that $d \in D(m, \mbox{\sc rem}(m,n))$.  By
Proposition~\ref{thm:m-common-divisor-nq}, $d$ divides every linear
combination of $m$ and $\mbox{\sc rem}(m,n)$.  In particular, $d$
divides the specific combination $q \cdot m \ + \ 1 \cdot \mbox{\sc rem}(m,n) \ = \ n$.  Thus,
$d$ divides $n$, so that $d \in D(m,n)$.
\end{itemize}
Since we thus have $D(m, n) \ = \ D(m, \mbox{\sc rem}(m,n))$, we know
that the sets contain the same largest element:
\[ \max\left( D(m, n) \right) \ = \ \max\left( D(m, \mbox{\sc
  rem}(m,n)) \right);
\]
the proposition follows.
\qed

\section{The Rational Numbers}
\label{sec:rationals}

Each enrichment of our number system throughout history has been a
response to a deficiency with the then-current system.  The deficiency
that instigated the introduction of the rational numbers was the fact
that many integers do not divide certain other integers.

This situation led to practical problems as civilization developed to
the point where communities strove to share commodities that were
physically divisible.  You can always cut a pizza into any desired
number of slices---but mandating such an action is awkward if you lack
the terminology to describe what you want to achieve.

The situation also led to an intellectual problem, when viewed from a
modern perspective.  
%Humans strive for conceptual parallelism.  
The arithmetic operation {\it multiplication} was surely recognized not
long after its slightly more fundamental sibling operation {\it
  addition}.  In many ways, these two operations mimic one another.
Both are {\em total bivariate functions} that take a pair of numbers
and produce a number; both are {\em commutative}, in that the argument
numbers can be presented in either order without changing the result:
\index{commutativity of addition}\index{commutativity of multiplication}
\[ (\forall a,b) \ \ \big[ [a+b \ = \ b+a]
 \ \ \ \mbox{ and } \ \ \
[a \cdot b \ = \ b \cdot a] \big]
\]
both are {\em associative}, in the sense asserted by the equations
\[
(\forall a,b) \ \ \big[ [a+(b+c) \ = \ (a+b)+c]
 \ \ \ \mbox{ and } \ \ \ 
[a \cdot (b \cdot c) \ = \ (a \cdot b) \cdot c] \big]
\]
If we restrict focus to the {\em integers}, however, there is a
glaring difference between addition and multiplication.  To wit,
addition has a ``partner operation'', {\it subtraction}, that operates
as a type of {\it inverse operation}:
\[ (\forall a, b, c) \big[ \mbox{if } \ \ [c = a + b] \ \ \mbox{ then }
  \ \ [a = c-b] \big]
\]
(We call $c-b$ the {\em difference} between $c$ and $b$.)  Within the
context of the integers, multiplication has no such ``partner''.  We
respond to this imbalance by inventing a ``partner'' for
multiplication, and we call it {\it division}, denoted $\div$.  Now,
division cannot completely mimic subtraction because of the technical
problems that arise from the {\em multiplicative annihilation}
\index{$0$: the multiplicative annihilator} properties of the integer
$0$:
\[ (\forall a) \left[ a \cdot 0 \ = \ 0 \cdot a \ = \ 0 \right] \] 
There is no way to ``undo'', or ``invert'' the operation
multiplication-by-$0$, because that operation is not one-to-one.  But
if we frame the operation of division carefully---specifically, by
avoiding division by $0$, then we can endow multiplication with the
desired ``partner'':
\[ (\forall a, b, c) \big[ \mbox{if } \ \ [c = a \cdot b] \ \
\mbox{ and if } \ \ [b \neq 0] \ \
 \mbox{ then }
  \ \ [a = c \div b] \big]
\]
(We call $c \div b$ the {\em quotient of $c$ by $b$}.)
\index{quotient} We are almost at the end of our journey.  All we need
is a way to speak about specific quotients.  When integer $b$ divides
integer $c$, as when $c = 12$ and $b = 4$, it is natural to write $12
\div 4 \ = \ 3$, but how should we denote the quotient $12 \div 5$
which is not an integer?  Enter the rational numbers!


\subsection{The Rationals: Special Ordered Pairs of Integers}
\label{sec:define-rationals}

The set $\Q$ of {\it rational} \index{number!rational} \index{$\Q$:
  the set of rational numbers} numbers---often abbreviated as just
``the rationals''---was invented to name the quotients referred to in
the preceding paragraph.  Formally:
\[ \Q \ \eqdef \ \{0\} \ \cup \ \left\{ p/q \ | \ p, q \in \Z
\setminus \{0\} \right\}
\]
Each element of $\Q$ is called a {\it rational} number;
\index{number!rational} each {\em nonzero} rational number $p/q$ is
often called a {\em fraction}; \index{number!fraction} some people
reserve the word ``fraction'' for the case $q > p$, because the word
seems to connote ``less than the whole'', but this does not seem to be
a valuable distinction.

In analogy with our treatment of integers, we reserve the notation
$\Q^+$ for the {\em positive} rationals.

An alternative, mathematically more advanced, way of defining the set
$\Q$ is as {\em the smallest set of numbers that contains the integers
  and is closed under the operation of dividing any number by any
  nonzero number.}  \index{algebraic closure} The word ``{\it
  closed}'' here means that, for every two numbers $p \in \Q$ and $q
\in \Q \setminus \{0\}$, the quotient $p/q$ belongs to $\Q$.

Numerous notations have been proposed for denoting rational numbers in
terms of the integers they are ``built from.''  Most of these
notations continue our custom of employing the single symbol ``$0$''
for the number $0$, but notations such as $0/q$ (where $q \neq 0$) are
permissible when they arise as part of a calculation or an analysis.
For the nonzero elements of $\Q$, we traditionally employ some
notation for the operation of division and denote the quotient of $p$
by $q$ using one of the following:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fraction}
 p/q \ \ \ \mbox{ or } \ \ \ {p \over q} \ \ \ \mbox{ or } \ \ \ p
 \div q
\end{equation}
The integer $p$ in any of the expressions in (\ref{eq:fraction}) is
the {\it numerator}
\index{number!rational!numerator}
\index{number!fraction!numerator}
of the fraction; the integer $q$ is the {\it denominator}.
\index{number!rational!denominator}
\index{number!fractions!denominator}


\subsection{The Rational Number line versus the Integer Number Line}
\label{sec:Compare-Q-Z}

There are many ways to compare the sets $\Z$ and $\Q$ in ways that
enhance our understanding of both sets.  We craft a comparison that
focuses on the similarities and differences in the two sets' number
lines, using Section~\ref{sec:integer-number-line} as the reference
for the integer number line.

As the first point in our comparison, we remark that every integer $n
\in \Z$ can be encoded as a rational \index{integers as rationals}
number.  Specifically, we represent/encode the integer $n \in \Z$ by
the rational $p/q$ whose numerator is $p = n$ and whose denominator is
$q = 1$.  This encoding is so intuitive that most people would write
``$n = n/1$'' and ignore the fact that this is expressing an encoding
rather than an equality.  We know with hindsight that this
intellectual shortcut can cause no problems, but it is important to be
aware that we are using a shortcut, for (at least) two reasons.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
We should contemplate {\em why} the encoding ``can cause no
problems.''  Answering this question will enhance our understanding of
both $\Z$ and $\Q$.  {\em What essential properties of rationals and
  integers does the proposed encoding preserve?}  To get started, note
that the encoding preserves the special characters of the numbers $0$
and $1$---because the following equations hold: $0/1 = 0$ and $1/1 =
1$.

\item
There are intuitively similar situations wherein one's intuition turns
out to be wrong!  One such situation occupies
Section~\ref{sec:Q-Z-cardinality}, wherein we demonstrate that the
sets $\Z$ and $\Q$ ``have the same size'', and the more advanced
Section~\ref{sec:Q-Z-R-cardinality}, wherein we show that the set $\R$
of real numbers is (in a formal sense) ``larger'' than sets $\Z$ and
$\Q$.  ({\em Even the fact that we can discuss the relative ``sizes''
  of infinite sets is interesting!})
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Comparing $\Z$ and $\Q$ via their number-line laws}
\label{sec:Q-Z-laws}
\index{number!rational!number line}

The rational numbers share some, but not all, of the number-line laws
of the integers, as enumerated in Section~\ref{sec:integers}.A.
We now adapt for $\Q$ that section's discussion of $\Z$'s number line.


The sets $\Q$ and $\Q^+$ are both {\em totally ordered}, in the manners
expressed by the Trichotomy laws for rational numbers.
\index{number!rational!total order}
\medskip

\noindent
{\it The Trichotomy laws for the rational numbers}
\index{Trichotomy laws for rationals}
\index{number!rational!Trichotomy laws}

\noindent (i)
%
{\it For each rational $a \in \Q$, precisely one of the following is true.}
\[
\mbox{ $a$ equals $0$:} \ (a=0) \ \ \ \
\ \mbox{ $a$ is {\em positive}:} \ (a>0) \ \ \ \
 \ \mbox{ $a$ is {\em negative}:} \ (a<0)
\]

\noindent (ii)
{\it Every rational $a \in \Q^+$ is positive} $(a>0)$.
\medskip

\noindent
The total ordering of $\Q$ is expressed as follows 
\index{number!rational!total order}

\noindent (iii)
{\it For any rationals $a, b \in \Q$, precisely one of the following
  is                               
  true.}
\[  a=b \ \ \ \mbox{or} \ \ \  a<b \ \ \ \mbox{or} \ \ \ a>b \]
\smallskip

As with the integers, the rationals can be visualized via a ($2$-way
infinite) number line.  But the rational line is much harder to
visualize, mainly because the rationals do {\em not} enjoy the
well-ordering or discreteness or ``between-ness'' of the integers.
\medskip

\noindent
{\em The set $\Q$ is {\em not} well-ordered.}

For illustration:  The set
\[ S \ = \ \{ a \in \Q  \ |\ 0 < a \leq 1 \} \]
has no smallest element.  If you give me a rational $p \in S$ that you
claim is the smallest element of the set, then I shall give you $p/2$
as a smaller one.
\medskip

\noindent
{\em The set $\Q$ does {\em not} obey the ``Between'' laws.}

In fact, $\Q$ violates the ``Between'' laws in a very strong way:
{\it For any two unequal rationals, $a$ and $b>a$, there are
  infinitely many rationals between $a$ and $b$.}

One can specify such an infinite set for the pair $a,b$ in myriad
ways.  Here is a simple such set, call it $S_{a,b}$.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:between-rationals}
S_{a,b} \ = \ \left\{ \frac{a+b}{k} \ \ | \ \ k \in \Z \right\}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Comparing $\Z$ and $\Q$ via their cardinalities}
\label{sec:Q-Z-cardinality}

Our final comparison between the rationals and the integers compares
the relative ``sizes'', or, {\em cardinalities} of $\Z$ and $\Q$.
Informally, {\it Are there ``more'' rationals than integers?}
\medskip

\noindent Consider the following facts.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Every integer is a rational number, as attested to by the ``encoding''
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ZintoQ}
\mbox{Encode } \ \ \ n \in \Z \ \ \ \mbox{ by } \ \ \ {n \over 1} \in \Q .
\end{equation}

\item
There are infinitely many non-integer rational numbers between every
pair of adjacent integers, as attested to by every set $S_{n,n+1}$ as
defined in (\ref{eq:between-rationals}).
\end{itemize}
Thus, the set $\Z$ of integers is a {\em proper} subset of the set
$\Q$ of rationals: symbolically, $\Z \subset \Q$.  To many, this
subset relation provides an intuitively compelling argument that \\
\hspace*{.35in}{\em there are more rational numbers than integers.}

For us---and for the general mathematical community---the preceding
intuition provides a compelling argument only for the fact that
reasoning about infinite sets demands subtlety and care.  For this
community, only the formal setting of
Section~\ref{sec:cardinality-NxN}.A allows us to reason cogently about
the relative ``sizes'' of infinite sets.  Within this setting, we show
that \\
\hspace*{.35in}{\em the set $\N$ has the same cardinality as the set $\Q$.}  \\
Mirroring Proposition~\ref{thm:|NxN|=|N|}, we have

\begin{prop}
\label{thm:|Q|=|N|}
$|\Q| \ = \ |\N|$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Since the proof of this result is adapted from that of
Proposition~\ref{thm:|NxN|=|N|}, we provide only a sketch, leaving
details to an exercise.

First, we note that the encoding $f$ defined by
\[ (\forall n \in \N) \left[ f(n) \ = \ \frac{n}{1} \right] \]
provides an injection from $\N$ into $\Q$.  This injection verifies
that $|\Q| \ \geq \ |\N|$.

For the converse relation, we proceed in two steps.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Let the function $g$ associate each rational $p/q \in \Q$ with the
ordered pair $\langle a, b \rangle \in \N \times \N$ that is obtained
by expressing $p/q$ in {\em lowest terms}; that is,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
$\displaystyle \frac{p}{q} \ = \ \frac{a}{b}$.
  \item
The rational $\displaystyle \frac{a}{b}$ is in {\em lowest terms}, in
the sense that $a$ and $b$ share no non-unit common divisor.
  \end{itemize}
Clearly, $g$ is an injection from $\Q$ into $\N \times \N$.

\item
Let the function $h$ be an injection from $\N \times \N$ into $\N$.
Sample such injections can be found in the proof of
Proposition~\ref{thm:|NxN|=|N|}.
\end{enumerate}
Since the composition of injections is again an injection, the
composite injection $g \circ h$ verifies
that $|\N| \ \geq \ |\Q|$.

Combining the preceding derived inequalities completes the proof.
\qed
\end{proof}


\section{The Real Numbers}
\label{sec:reals}

\subsection{Inventing the Real Numbers}
\label{sec:real-history}

Each subsequent augmentation of our system of numbers inevitably gets
more complicated than the last: one solves the easy problems first.
The deficiency in the system of rational numbers harkens back to
historical time, roughly $2 {1 \over 2}$ millennia ago.  The ancient
Egyptians were prodigious builders who mastered truly sophisticated
mathematics in order to engineer their temples and pyramids.  The
ancient Greeks perpetuated this engineering tradition, but they added
to it the philosophical ``soul'' of mathematics.

Numbers were (literally) sacred objects to many (philosophically
oriented) Greeks, and they invented ways of thinking about
mathematical phenomena that are quite ``modern'' to our perspective,
in order to understand {\em why} certain facts were true, in addition
to knowing {\em that} they were true.  One intellectual project in
this spirit had to do with the way they designed constructions such as
temples.  They were attracted to geometric contructions that could be
accomplished using only {\em straight-edges and compasses}.
And---most relevant to our story---they preferred that the relative
lengths of linear sections of their structures be {\em commensurable},
\index{number!integer!commensurable pairs of integers} in the
following sense.  {\em Integers $x,y \in \N$ are {\em commensurable}
  if there exist $a, b \in \N$ such that}
\[ 
ax \ = \ by \ \ \ \ \mbox{ or, equivalently, } \ \ \ \ x \ = \ \frac{b}{a} y.
\]
As Greek philosophers contemplated their desire to employ
commensurable pairs of integers in constructions, they discovered that
this goal was impossible even in moderately simple constructions.  The
``poster child'' of this assertion is perceptible in {\it the diagonal
  of the square with unit-length sides} or, equivalently, in {\it the
  hypotenuse of the isosceles right triangle with unit-length legs}.
In both situations, one found that the unit lengths of the structure's
sides or of its legs were accompanied by the inevitably {\em
  non-commensurability} of the length of the square's diagonal or the
triangle's hypotenuse; in current terminology, the length of the
diagonal and the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{2}$.  The Greek mathematicians,
as reported by the renowned mathematician\index{Euclid}
Euclid,\footnote{Euclid wrote extensively on this and related
  subjects, especially regarding geometry and what is currently known
  as number theory.}~proved, using current terminology, that $\sqrt{2}$
is not rational.  (We rephrase Euclid's proof imminently, in
Proposition~\ref{thm:sqrt(2)}.)  The conclusion from this proof is
that a number system based solely on the integers and rationals was
inadequate.  In response, the philosophers augmented our number system
by introducing {\it surds} \index{number!surd} or, as we more commonly
term them, {\it radicals} \index{number!radical}.  The augmentation
thus begun culminated in what we know as the real number system.
Since our intention in this introduction has been to justify the
journey along that trajectory, we leave our historical digression and
turn to our real focus, the set $\R$ of {\it real numbers}.
\index{number!real}

\subsection{Defining the Real Numbers via Their Numerals}
\label{sec:define-Reals}

For any integer $b > 1$, the real numbers are the numbers that can be
named by {\em infinite} strings built out of the digits $\{0, 1,
\ldots, b-1\}$;\footnote{This is not the traditional way that a
  mathematician would define the set of real numbers, but it is
  correct and adequate for thinking about the set.}~the resulting
strings are called {\em $b$-ary numerals}.  There are a couple of ways
to form $b$-ary numerals; we shall discuss some of the most common
ones in Section~\ref{sec:Numerals}.  For now, we define real numbers
as those that can be represented by a {\it base-$b$ numeral},
\index{base-$b$ numeral}
for some integer {\it base} $b >1$.
\index{number base}
Such a numeral is a string of the form
\[
\alpha_n \alpha_{n-1} \cdots \alpha_1 \alpha_0                  
. \beta_0 \beta_1 \beta_2 \cdots
\]
\index{positional number system!numerical value of numeral}
and represents the (real) number
\[
NUM_b(alpha_n \alpha_{n-1} \cdots \alpha_1 \alpha_0                  
. \beta_0 \beta_1 \beta_2 \cdots)
\ \ \eqdef \ \
\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i \cdot b^i
\ + \ \sum_{j\geq 0} \beta_j \cdot b^{-j}.
\]
By prepending a ``negative sign'' (or, ``minus sign'') $-$ to a
numeral or a number, one renders the thus-embellished entity as
negative.

{\Denis I put NUM here without telling what it is, there is a reference to 4.7 where you defined NUM and the positional numerals, but I think the whole definition 
should be placed here and 4.7 should refer to this section, are you OK with this?}

\subsection{Not All Real Numbers Are Rational}
\label{sec:Real-vs-Rational}

We close this section by verifying the earlier-mentioned assertion
about the non-commensurability of the length of the diagonal of a
square with the (common) length of its sides---or, equivalently, the
leg-length of an isosceles right triangle with the length of its
hypotenuse.
\index{The non-commensurabiliy of $\sqrt{2}$}


\begin{prop}
\label{thm:sqrt(2)}
The real number $\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}$ is not rational.
\end{prop}

As with many results that arise in our mathematical journey, we
provide multiple---in this case, two---proofs for
Proposition~\ref{thm:sqrt(2)}, which build upon quite different
mathematical insights.  In Section~\ref{sec:classical-proof-sqrt(2)}
we provide the classical proof of the result.  This proof invokes a
simple provision of Theorem~\ref{thm:Fund-Thm-Arith}, to exploit the
divisibility properties of integers.  In
Section~\ref{sec:geom-proof-sqrt(2)}, we provide a proof of the
results that builds on the Pythagorean Theorem
(Theorem~\ref{thm:Pythagorean-thm}) to develop geometric insights.

\subsubsection*{Using divisibility to prove that $\sqrt{2} \not\in \Q$}
\label{sec:classical-proof-sqrt(2)}

\begin{proof}
We now prove Proposition~\ref{thm:sqrt(2)} {\em by
contradiction},\index{proof by contradiction} a proof technique
described in Chapter~\ref{sec:practical-logic}.

{\Denis I don't think you should refer to the type of proof here (contradiction)....
I let you choose if we keep the remark or not. Or should we systematically refer to the type of proof used?}

Let us assume, for contradiction, that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational.  By
definition, then, $\sqrt{2}$ can be written as a quotient
\[ \sqrt{2} \ = \ {a \over b} \]
for positive integers $a$ and $b$.  In fact, we can also insist that
$a$ and $b$ {\em share no common prime factor}.  For, if $a$ and $b$
shared the prime factor $p$, then we would have $a = p \cdot c$ and
$b = p \cdot d$.  In this case, though, we would have
\[ \sqrt{2} \ = \ {a \over b} \ = \ \frac{p \cdot c}{p \cdot d}
\ = \ {c \over d},
\]
by cancellation of the common factor $p$.  We can eliminate further
common prime factors if necessary until, finally, we find a quotient
for $\sqrt{2}$ whose numerator and denominator share no common prime
factor.  This must occur eventually because each elimination of a
common factor leaves us with smaller integers, so the iterative
elimination of common factors must terminate.

Let us say that, finally,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sqrt2-1}
\sqrt{2} \ = \ {k \over \ell}
\end{equation}
where $k$ and $\ell$ share no common prime factor.  Let us square both
expressions in (\ref{eq:sqrt2-1}) and multiply both sides of the
resulting equation by $\ell^2$.  We thereby discover that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sqrt2-2}
2 \ell^2 \ = \ k^2.
\end{equation}
This rewriting exposes the fact that $k^2$ is {\em even},\index{integer!even}
i.e., {\em divisible by $2$}.  But, Theorem~\ref{thm:Fund-Thm-Arith}
tells us that {\em if $k^2$ is divisible by $2$, then so also is $k$}.
This means that $k = 2m$ for some positive integer $m$, which allows
us to rewrite (\ref{eq:sqrt2-2}) in the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sqrt2-3}
2 \ell^2 \ = \ k^2 \ = \ (2m)^2 \ = \ 4m^2.
\end{equation}
Hence, we can divide the first and last quantities in
(\ref{eq:sqrt2-3}) by $2$, to discover that
\[ \ell^2 \ = \ 2m^2. \]
Repeating the invocation of Theorem~\ref{thm:Fund-Thm-Arith} now tells
us that the integer $\ell$ must be even.  We now see that {\em both
  $k$ and $\ell$ are even, i.e., divisible by $2$}.  This contradicts
our assumption that $k$ and $\ell$ share no common prime divisor!

Since every step of our argument is ironclad---except for our
assumption that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, we conclude that that
assumption is false!  The Proposition is verified. \qed

\ignore{\Denis Here is a detailed (geometric) proof of the result.
I hope this is convincing now, I changed a little the way to prove the result...}

\subsubsection*{A geometric proof that $\sqrt{2} \not\in \Q$}
\label{sec:geom-proof-sqrt(2)}

\begin{proof}
Our geometric proof repeatedly invokes Fig.~\ref{fig:irrationality1}, which
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FiguresArithmetic/sqrt2initial}
\caption{{\it A geometric depiction the Pythagorean Theorem and its
    underlying equation: $a^2 = b^2 + b^2$.}
\label{fig:irrationality1}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
suggestively invokes the Pythagorean Theorem.  The figure presents
three squares.  The intention is that the two small grey squares are
identical, with common area $A$, while the large white square has
double this area.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, if the small squares
have (common) side-lengths $b \in \N^+$, hence shared area $A = b^2$ each,
then the large square has side-lengths $a \eqdef \sqrt{2}b$, hence
area $a^2 = 2 b^2$.

Thus set up, we begin to pursue our contradiction.  
As in the classical proof shown above,
%in Section~\ref{sec:classical-proof-sqrt(2)}, 
we start with the assumption that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational.  Within the context
of Fig.~\ref{fig:irrationality1}, this means that
\[ \sqrt{2} \ = \ {a \over b} \]
for $a, b \in \N^+$.  Since all that we have said thus far holds for
arbitrary $a$ and $b$, we are free to consider the assumption's
implications for the same situation as before,
%Section~\ref{sec:classical-proof-sqrt(2)}, 
namely, that $a$ and $b$ do
not share any common prime factor.  Note additionally that,
because\footnote{If this inequality is new to you, then just note that
  $(1.4)^2 = 1.96$, which is less than $2$.}
\[ \sqrt{2} \ > \ 1.4, \]
we know that $a > b$.
\medskip

\noindent \fbox{
\begin{minipage}{0.97\textwidth}
%\[ \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \]
Of course, our demands on the relationship between the numerator $a$
and the denominator $b$ lose no generality in our argument.  To wit,
``$\displaystyle {a \over b}$'' is just one name for the depicted
rational number, and choosing any specific name has no impact on the
number itself.
%\[ \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \]
\end{minipage}
}
\medskip

Now that we have the suggestive ``equation'' presented in
Fig.~\ref{fig:irrationality1}, we can manipulate the depicted squares.
Let us embed both of the grey $b \times b$ squares of
Fig.~\ref{fig:irrationality1} into the white $a \times a$ square, in
the overlapped manner depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:irrationality2}:
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FiguresArithmetic/sqrt2final}
\caption{{\it Construction of a smaller pythagorian equation.}
\label{fig:irrationality2}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
one grey square is nestled into the northwestern corner of the white
square, while the other is nestled into the southeastern corner.
The overlapping of the grey squares under this
embedding creates a new square---depicted in dark grey---in the center
of the white square, while it leaves unoccupied two small squares,
which remain white in the figure.

Now, let us get quantitative.
\begin{itemize}
\item
On the first side, the fact that the combined areas of the two grey squares equal the
area of the white square guarantees that the area of the dark grey
overlap-square is equal to the combined areas of the small unoccupied
white squares.

\item
On the other side, because the side-lengths of the large white square is $a$, while those
of the grey squares is $b$, the side-lengths of the small white square
is $a-b$, and the side-lengths of the dark grey overlap-square is
$2b-a$.  All of these side-lengths are positive because of the value
of $\sqrt{2}$: ($i$) $a > b$ because $\sqrt{2} >1$; ($ii$) $2b >a$
because $\sqrt{2} < 2$.
\end{itemize}
The preceding facts allow us to label the squares of
Fig.~\ref{fig:irrationality1} differently than we did earlier---and
derive a different valid ``equation''.  As we did at the beginning of
this discussion, we again invoke the Pythagorian Theorem, but now we
do so while focusing---cf., Fig.~\ref{fig:irrationality2}---on the
dark grey overlap-square (which plays the role of the large square in
Fig.~\ref{fig:irrationality1}) and the two small white squares (which
play the role of the two small squares in
Fig.~\ref{fig:irrationality1}).  Whereas our original focus led to the
putative rational value $\displaystyle {a \over b}$ for $\sqrt{2}$,
the new focus yields the putative rational value $\displaystyle {2b-a
  \over a-b}$ for $\sqrt{2}$.  We thus have
\[ \sqrt{2} \ = \ {a \over b} \ = \ {2b-a \over a-b}, \]
where $2b-a < a$ and $a-b < b$.  In the light of the Fundamental
Theorem of Arithmetic (Theorem~\ref{thm:Fund-Thm-Arith}), this new
rational name for $\sqrt{2}$ contradicts our beginning assumption that
$\displaystyle {a \over b}$ is the simplest name.

\subsection{$\R$ is uncountable, hence is ``bigger than'' $\Z$ and $\Q$}
\label{sec:Q-Z-R-cardinality}
\label{sec:Reals-uncountable}

\ignore{\Arny Do we want to include the diagonal argument.  It is beautiful --- but is it ``core''?}
\ignore{\Denis yes, I think so}

The main result of this section establishes the uncountability of the
set $\R$.  We thereby have an argument that the infinitude of real
numbers is {\em of a higher order} than the infinitude of the
integers.  In fact, Georg Cantor used this result as the base of
his study of orders of infinity.

\begin{prop}
\label{thm:R-uncountable}
The set $\R$ of real numbers is not countable.
In particular, there is no injection $f: \R \rightarrow \N$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Our multi-step proof shows that the assumption of $\R$'s countability
leads to a contradiction.  Being built around Georg Cantor's renowned
{\it diagonalization construction}, \index{diagonalization} this
argument provides the most sophisticated proof by contradiction in our
text.  The reader might want to review the reasoning underlying such
argumentation, in Section~\ref{sec:Contradiction}, as a ``warm-up.''

\subsubsection{Plotting a strategy to prove uncountability}
\label{sec:the-diag-strategy}

Invoking the definition of countability, our proof begins with the
assumption that $|\R| \leq |\N|$ and demonstrates that this assumption
leads to a contradiction.  We simplify our goal in several steps.

{\it (a) Recasting the problem in terms of bijections.}
We now set out to recast our goal into a form that will be easier to
manage mathematically, by invoking our prior knowledge about the sets
$\N$ and $\R$.  We begin with two simplifying lemmas.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:N-leq-R}
There exists an injection $f: \N \rightarrow \R$; i.e., $|\N| \leq
|\R|$.
\end{lemma}

\noindent {\it Verification}.

{\Denis It sounds like we have a confusion for the definition of NUMb...
In the other parts, NUM is the integer}
%
For each nonnegative integer $n \in \N$, let $\mbox{\sc num}_b(n)$
denote the shortest base-$b$ numeral for $n$, i.e., a numeral with no
leading $0$s.  The mapping that associates each $n \in \N$ with the
infinite string
\[ \mbox{\sc num}_b(n) \ . \ 00 \cdots \]
is an injection from $\N$ into $\R$.  To wit, when given a real
numeral that has only $0$s to the right of its radix point, one
produces the integer $n$ by stripping the numeral of its radix point
and all $0$s to the right of the point, and then evaluating the
remaining string of digits, which is $\mbox{\sc num}_b(n)$, according
to Section~\ref{sec:define-Reals}'s rules for evaluating integer
numerals.  \qed

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:N-=-R}
If there exists an injection $g: \R \rightarrow \N$, then there exists
a bijection $h: \N \leftrightarrow \R$.  In other words, if $|\R| \leq
|\N|$, then $|\N| = |\R|$.
\end{lemma}

\noindent {\it Verification}.
This is an immediate consequence of the Schr\"{o}der-Bernstein Theorem
(Theorem~\ref{thm.S-B}).  \qed

\medskip

It is somewhat surprising that our proof is simplified by converting
our initial assumption \\
\hspace*{.35in}$|\R| \leq |\N|$ \\
to the stronger assumption \\
\hspace*{.35in}$|\R| \ = \ |\N|$,  \\
but Cantor's diagonal argument deals quite gracefully with the latter
assumption.

\medskip

{\it (b) Focus on real numbers between $0$ and $1$.}
Our next refinement replaces our target set $\R$ by its proper subset
$\R_{(0,1)}$, all of whose elements have infinite decimal numerals of
the form
\[ 0 \ . \ \delta_0 \delta_1 \cdots \]
where each $\delta_i$ is a decimal digit: $\delta_i \in \{0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.\footnote{We choose {\em decimal} numerals for
  convenience: converting the argument to other number
  bases---especially the base $b=2$---slightly complicates clerical
  details.}

Of course, if we prove that the proper subset $\R_{(0,1)} \subset \R$
is uncountable, then it will follow that $\R$ is uncountable.  (In
informal terms which can be made formal, any putative injection $f: \R
\rightarrow \N$ ``contains'' an injection $f_{(0,1)}: \R_{(0,1)}
\rightarrow \N$.)

\paragraph{\small\sf A. Seeking a bijection $h: \N \leftrightarrow \R_{(0,1)}$}

We assume, for contradiction, that the targeted bijection $g$ exists.
As part of this two-way mapping, there exists an {\em injection}
\[ 
h: \N \ \rightarrow \ \R_{(0,1)},
\]
which we view as an {\em enumeration} of the elements of $\R_{(0,1)}$.
Specifically, for each integer $k \in \N$, we can think of $h(k)$ as
the ``$k$th number in the set $\R_{(0,1)}$.''  We thereby view $h$ as
producing an ``infinite-by-infinite'' matrix $\Delta$ of decimal
digits, whose $k$th row is the infinite string of decimal digits
$\mbox{\sc num}_{10}(h(k))$.  Let us visualize $\Delta$:
\[ \Delta \ = \
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
\delta_0 = &
\delta_{0,0} & \delta_{0,1} & \delta_{0,2} & \delta_{0,3} &
	\delta_{0,4} & \cdots \\
\delta_1 = &
\delta_{1,0} & \delta_{1,1} & \delta_{1,2} & \delta_{1,3} &
	\delta_{1,4} & \cdots \\
\delta_2 = &
\delta_{2,0} & \delta_{2,1} & \delta_{2,2} & \delta_{2,3} &
	\delta_{2,4} & \cdots \\
\delta_3 = &
\delta_{3,0} & \delta_{3,1} & \delta_{3,2} & \delta_{3,3} &
	\delta_{3,4} & \cdots \\ 
\delta_4 = &
\delta_{4,0} & \delta_{4,1} & \delta_{4,2} & \delta_{4,3} &
	\delta_{4,4} & \cdots \\ 
\vdots &
\vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots
\end{array}
\]

\noindent We summarize, for emphasis:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Each row of $\Delta$ consists of the decimal numeral for a number in
the set $\R_{(0,1)}$.

\item
Each number in the set $\R_{(0,1)}$ contributes at least one numeral
to the rows of $\Delta$.

A number may contribute more than one numeral because of an artifact
of positional number systems, which is exemplified by equations such
as
\[ 0.25 \ = \ 0.24999\cdots \]
\end{itemize}
We can, thus, view the successive rows of $\Delta$, $h(0)$, $h(1)$,
\ldots, as an enumeration (with possible repetitions) of all of the
real numbers in the set $\R_{(0,1)}$.

\paragraph{\small\sf B. Every bijection $h: \N \leftrightarrow \R$
  ``misses'' some real}
%$x \in \R_{(0,1)}$}

We are finally poised to find the contradiction to our assumption that
$|\R_{(0,1)}| \leq |\N|$.  Specifically, we define from $\Delta$ an
infinite decimal numeral
\[ \Psi \ = \ \psi_0 \ \psi_1 \ \psi_2 \ \psi_3 \ \psi_4 \cdots, \]
that {\em does not} appear in $\Delta$, even though $\mbox{\sc
  num}_{10}(\Psi) \in \R_{(0,1)}$.  For each index $i \in \N$, we
define the $i$th digit $\psi_i$ of $\Psi$ from the $i$th {\em diagonal
  digit}\footnote{Our use of $\Delta$'s ``diagonal digits'' in this
  definition is the origin of the term ``{\em diagonal argument}'' to
  describe this proof and its intellectual kin.}~$\delta_{i,i}$ of
$\Delta$ in the following manner.
\[ \psi_i \ \eqdef \
%= \ \overline{\delta}_{i,i} \ \eqdef \
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & \mbox{ if } \ \delta_{i,i} \ > \ 5 \\
9 & \mbox{ if } \ \delta_{i,i} \ \leq \ 5 \\
\end{array}
\right.
\]
The important feature of the definition is the following.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:PSI-notin-DELTA}
The string $\Psi$ does not occur as a row of $\Delta$.
\end{lemma}

\noindent {\it Verification}.
Focus on an arbitrary row of $\Delta$, say row $k$, and on the numeral,
$\delta_k$, in that row.

\begin{tabular}{lclc}
If & $\delta_{k,k} \ > \ 5$ & then & \ \
$\mbox{\sc num}_{10}(\delta_k) \ - \ \mbox{\sc num}_{10}(\Psi) \ > \ 4
\cdot 10^{-k}$ \\
If & $\delta_{k,k} \ \leq \ 5$ & then & \ \
$\mbox{\sc num}_{10}(\Psi) \ - \ \mbox{\sc num}_{10}(\delta_k) \ > \ 4
\cdot 10^{-k}$
\end{tabular}

\noindent
In either case, we have $\mbox{\sc num}_{10}(\Psi) \ \neq \ \mbox{\sc
  num}_{10}(\delta_k)$ so that $\Psi$ does not appear as row $k$ of
$\Delta$.  Since $k \in \N$ is an arbitrary row-index of $\Delta$, we
conclude that $\Psi$ does not occur as any row of $\Delta$.  \qed

\subsubsection{The denouement: There is no bijection  $h: \N \leftrightarrow \R$}

Because the infinite decimal string $\Psi$ differs from every row of
$\Delta$, even though $\mbox{\sc num}_{10}(\Psi) \in \R_{(0,1)}$, we have
shown that $\Delta$ {\em does not} contain as a row {\em every}
infinite decimal numeral of a number in $\R_{(0,1)}$.  But this
contradicts $\Delta$'s assumed defining characteristic!

Where could we have gone wrong?  Every step of our argument, save one,
is backed up by a proof---so the one step that is not so bolstered
must be the link that has broken.  This one unsubstantiated step is
our assumption that the set $\R_{(0,1)}$ is countable.  Since this
assumption has led us to a contradiction, we must conclude that the
set $\R_{(0,1)}$, and hence, the set $\R$, is {\em not} countable!
\qed
\end{proof}

{\Denis The result and the proof are fine, however, I am sure we can simplify 
the presentation of the successive steps more clearly. I will come back later at this...

\section{The Complex Numbers}
\label{sec:complexes}

\subsection{The Basics of the Complex Numbers}

Let us denote by $\C$ the set of complex numbers.  Each number $\kappa
= a+bi \in \C$ has a {\it real} \index{number!complex!real part} {\em
  part}---the part that {\em does not} involve the imaginary unit
\index{$i$: the imaginary unit} $i$---and an {\it imaginary}
\index{number!complex!imaginary part} {\em part}---the part that {\em
  does} involve $i$.  To be explicit: the real part of our number
$\kappa$, is \index{complex number!real part Re($\cdot$)} Re$(\kappa)
= a$; the {\it imaginary part} of our number $\kappa$,is
\index{complex number!imaginary part Im($\cdot$)} Im$(\kappa) = b$.
\index{complex number!imaginary part Im($\cdot$)} The notation
Re$(\kappa)$ and Im$(\kappa)$ is common but not universal.

\index{complex number!multiplication!three real multiplications}
Using the basic arithmetic laws that we have discussed thus far, plus
the defining equation, $i^2 = -1$, of the imaginary unit $i$, we find
that the {\em product} of two complex numbers, $a+bi \in \C$ and $c+di
\in \C$ is the complex number, call it $\kappa$,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:complex-mult}
\kappa \ = \ (a+bi) \cdot (c+di) \ = \ (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i.
\end{equation}
We note that a ``direct'' implementation of complex multiplication,
i.e., one that implements (\ref{eq:complex-mult}) literally, requires
four real multiplications---namely, $ac, bd, ad, bc$.

During the 1960s, people first began to pay close attention to the
costs associated with various ways of achieving computational results.
They sought---and found---a number of procedures that replaced
computations involving $k$ real multiplications (a relatively
expensive operation) and $\ell$ real additions (a relatively
inexpensive operation) by computations that achieved the same result
but used fewer multiplications and not too many more additions.
Complex multiplication was one of the operations they studied.  Here
is the result.

\ignore{******************
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{-- A fun result: complex
  multiplication via $3$ real multiplications}
\index{complex number!multiplication via 3 real multiplications}

\begin{prop}
\label{thm:complex-mult-3real}
One can compute the product of two complex numbers using {\em three}
real multiplications rather than four.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Although implementing (\ref{eq:complex-mult}) ``directly'' correctly
produces the product $\kappa = (a+bi) \cdot (c+di)$, there is another
implementation that is {\em more efficient}.  Specifically, the
following recipe computes $\kappa$ using only {\em three} real
multiplications instead of the four real multiplications of the
``direct'' implementation.  We begin to search for this recipe by
noting that our immediate goal is to compute both Re$(\kappa) = ac-bd$
and Im$(\kappa) = ad+bc$.  We can accomplish this by computing the
{\em three} real products
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:complex-mult-3a}
(a+b) \cdot (c+d); \ \ \ \ \
ac;  \ \ \ \ \ bd
\end{equation}
and then noting that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:complex-mult-3b}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\mbox{Im}(\kappa) & = & (a+b) \cdot (c+d) - ac -bd, \\
\mbox{Re}(\kappa) & = & ac -bd
\end{array}
\end{equation}
We thereby achieve the result of the complex multiplication described
in (\ref{eq:complex-mult}) while using only {\em three} real
multiplications.

Of course, a full reckoning of the costs of the two implementations we
have discussed exposes the fact that the implementation that invokes
(\ref{eq:complex-mult-3a}) and (\ref{eq:complex-mult-3b}) uses {\em
  three} real additions rather than the {\em two} real additions of
the ``direct'' implementation.  But this entire exercise was
predicated on the observation that each real addition is much less
costly than a real multiplication, so trading one multiplication for
one addition is an unqualified ``win''.  \qed
\end{proof}

{\Denis I added a sentence to refer to an exercice dealing with karatsuba which uses the same idea...}
Notice that this technique is classical and it has been used in many other situations.
For instance while multiplying two integers in base 2 (see exercice~\ref{Karatsuba}).

\index{positional number system}

The most common family of {\em operational}
\index{numerals!operational} numerals for real numbers---i.e.,
numerals that enable one to do things such as perform arithmetic (add,
multiply, etc.) on the named numbers---is the family of {\it
  positional number systems}.  Each system in this family is
identified by its {\em base}, 
\index{positional number system!base}
which is usually\footnote{In rather specialized contexts one
  encounters number bases that are not positive integers.}~an
integer $b >1$.
\index{positional number system!base-$b$ numeral}
For any base $b$, we define the set $B_b = \{ 0, 1, \ldots, b-1\}$ of
{\it digits in base $b$}.\index{positional number system!digits in
  base $b$}
%
To aid legibility, {\em within the context of base-$b$ positional
  numerals}, we denote the digit $b-1$ as a single character, $\bar{b}$.
\index{$\bar{b}$: the digit $b-1$ in base $b$}

We then form base-$b$ numerals in the following way.

}
%\[ \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \approx \]
\end{minipage}
}
\medskip

{\Denis the following should be put before in 4.5.2}

A base-$b$ numeral is a string having three segments.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The numeral begins with its {\em integer part},
\index{positional number system!integer part of a numeral}
%
which is a {\em finite} string of digits from $B_b$.  We denote the
integer-part string as: $\alpha_n \alpha_{n-1} \cdots \alpha_1
\alpha_0$.

\item
The numeral continues with a single occurrence of the {\it
  radix point}\index{positional number system!radix point ``$.$''}
``$.$''

\item
The numeral ends with its {\em fractional part},\index{positional
  number system!fractional part of a numeral}
%
which is a string---{\em finite or infinite}--- of digits from $B_b$.
We denote the fractional-part string as:
$\beta_0 \beta_1 \beta_2 \cdots$.
\end{enumerate}
Our completed numeral now has the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:real-numeral}
\alpha_n \alpha_{n-1} \cdots \alpha_1 \alpha_0
\ . \ \beta_0 \beta_1 \beta_2 \cdots
\end{equation}
where the $\alpha_i$ and the $\beta_j$
\index{positional number system!base-$b$ digits} 
are {\em base-$b$ digits} i.e., elements of the set $B_b$, and
``$.$'' represents the {\em (base-$b$) radix point}.

\noindent
The numeral depicted in (\ref{eq:real-numeral}) represents the (real)
number\footnote{The notation ``$\mbox{\sc num}_{10}(x)$'' in
  (\ref{eq:real-numeral-number}) denotes an operator that produces the
  {\em numerical value} of the numeral $x$ written in base-$b$.}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:real-numeral-number}
\mbox{\sc num}_{10}(\alpha_n \alpha_{n-1} \cdots \alpha_1 \alpha_0                  
\ . \ \beta_0 \beta_1 \beta_2 \cdots)
\ \ \eqdef \ \
\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i \cdot b^i
\ + \ \sum_{j\geq 0} \beta_j \cdot b^{-j}.
\end{equation}
\index{positional number system!numerical value of numeral}

For emphasis, we note that the base-$b$ integer 
\index{positional number system!numerical value of integral part}
represented by the numeral's integer part is
\[
\mbox{\sc num}_{10}(\alpha_n \alpha_{n-1}\cdots \alpha_1 \alpha_0)
\ \ = \ \
\sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_i \cdot b^i
\]
and the base-$b$ fraction represented by the numeral's fractional part
is\index{positional number system!numerical value of fractional part}
\[
\mbox{\sc num}_{10}(. \beta_0 \beta_1 \beta_2 \cdots)
\ \ = \ \
\sum_{j\geq 0} \beta_j \cdot b^{-j}
\]
By prepending a ``minus sign'' (or, ``negative sign'') $-$ to a
numeral or a number, one renders the thus-embellished entity as
negative.

\medskip

Note that {\em two types of sequences of $0$s do not affect the value
  of the number represented by a numeral:} (1) an {\em initial}
sequence of $0$s to the {\em left} of the radix point and of all
non-$0$ digits; (2) a {\em terminal} sequence of $0$s to the {\em
  right} of the radix point and of all non-$0$ digits.

One consequence of this fact is that we lose no generality by
insisting that every numeral have the following {\em normal form:}

\subsection{Recognizing Integers and  Rationals from Their Numerals}
\label{sec:special-numerals-N-Q}

We have provided an adequate, albeit inelegant, characterization of
the real numbers: a number $r$ is real if, and only if, it can be
represented by an infinite-length numeral in a positional number
system.  Because every rational number---hence, also, every
integer---is also a real number, every rational number and every
integer can also be written as a $b$-ary numeral, in the form
(\ref{eq:real-numeral}).  For rational numbers and integers, we can
make much stronger statements about the forms of their positional
numerals.

{\Denis We have to add a brief discussion about k-ary and k-adic systems...}

\subsubsection{Positional numerals for integers}
\label{sec:special-numerals-N}

\begin{prop}
\label{thm:integer-real}
A real number is an integer if, and only if, it can be represented by
a {\em finite-length} numeral all of whose nonzero digits are to the
left of the radix point.
\index{number!integer!real with a finite numeral}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The result is immediate by definition (\ref{eq:real-numeral-number}).
In the indicated form, if any $\beta_i$ is nonzero, then the {\sc
value} of the numeral is non-integral: it has a nonzero fractional part.
\qed
\end{proof}

We can go beyond the simple statement of
Proposition~\ref{thm:integer-real} and present the following algorithm
that computes the normal-form base-$b$ numeral for an integer $n$.

{\Denis I think it would be better to give the process in literal form as the rest of the chapter...}
\bigskip

\noindent {\underline{\bf Procedure}} {\small\sf Normal-Form

/*Compute the normal-form numeral for a given integer $n$*/
\smallskip

\noindent{\bf Initialization}.

\noindent{\bf Iterate until}
{\sc current-residue} $= 1$

Divide {\sc current-residue} by $b$
\medskip

\noindent
The {\em remainder} upon each division is the next lowest-order
digit in the base-$b$ numeral for $n$.
\bigskip

\noindent {\it Validating the procedure.}
%
The procedure is an implementation of a method of rewriting univariate
polynomials, known variously as {\it Horner's rule} or {\it Horner's
  scheme} \cite{Horner}.  
\index{Horner's rule} \index{Horner's scheme}
Among its other virtues, the ``rule'' provides a recipe for computing
a degree-$d$ univariate polynomial using $O(d)$ multiplications,
rather than the $\Theta(d^2)$ multiplications that appear at first to
be needed.

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\item {\small\sf The ``standard'' way of writing the polynomial $P(x)$.}

\noindent General degree $d$:

$P(x) \ \ = \ \ a_0 \ + \ a_1 x \ + \ a_2 x^2 \ + \cdots + \ a_{d-1}
x^{d-1} \ + \ a_d x^d$

\noindent Degree $3$:

$P(x) \ \ = \ \ a_0 \ + \ a_1 x \ + \ a_2 x^2 \ + \ a_3 x^3$

\item {\small\sf Rewriting $P(x)$ using Horner's rule.}

\noindent General degree $d$:

$P(x) \ \ = \ \ a_0 \ + \ x \cdot (a_1 \ + \ x \cdot (a_2  \ +  \cdots
+ x \cdot (a_{d-2} \ + \ x \cdot (a_{d-1} \ + \ a_d x)) \cdots ))$  

\noindent Degree $3$:

$P(x) \ \ = \ \ a_0 \ + \ x \cdot (a_1 \ + \ x \cdot (a_2  \ + \ a_3 x))$ 
\end{itemize}

The ``rule'' is so natural that its origins certainly predate the
cited 1819 publication, but they are impossible to trace definitively.  \qed 

\bigskip

\noindent {\it Illustrating the procedure.}
We use the procedure to produce the normal-form base-$2$ (binary)
numeral for $n = 143$.

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{|c|r|r|}
\hline
Step &
{\sc current-residue} &
Remainder \\
\hline
1. & $143$ & $1$ \\
2. & $71$  & $1$ \\
3. & $35$  & $1$ \\
4. & $17$  & $1$ \\
5. & $8$   & $0$ \\
6. & $4$   & $0$ \\
7. & $2$   & $0$ \\
8. & $1$   & $1$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\medskip

\noindent
We have thus derived the following equation which specifies the
base-$2$ normal-form numeral for $143$.
\[ 143_{10} \ = \ 10001111_2 \]


\subsubsection{Positional numerals for rationals}
\label{sec:special-numerals-Q}

We can completely characterize the positional numerals that represent
rational numbers, in terms of the auxiliary notion of an {\em ultimately
  periodic} infinite sequence of digits.
\index{ultimately periodic sequence}

An infinite sequence $S$ of numbers is {\em ultimately periodic} if
there exist two {\em finite} sequences of numbers, $A$ and $B$, such
that $S$ can be written in the following form (we have added spaces to
enhance legibility):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ult-per-seq}
 S \ = \ A \ B \ B \ B \cdots B \ B \cdots
\end{equation}
The intention here is that the sequence $B$ is repeated {\it ad
  infinitum}.


\begin{prop}
\label{thm:rational-real}
A positional numeral denotes a rational number if, and only if, it is
ultimately periodic.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
{\small\sf Part 1: the ``if'' clause.}

Say first that the real number $r$ has an ultimately periodic infinite
base-$b$ numeral.

Since the exact lengths of the finite sequences $A$ and $B$ that
constitute the numeral, as in (\ref{eq:ult-per-seq}), are not germane
to the argument, we arbitrarily denote $r$ by the following
normal-form numeral (spaces added to enhance legibility):
\[  a_2 a_1 a_0 \ . \ b_0 b_1 \
c_0 c_1 c_2 \
c_0 c_1 c_2
\cdots
c_0 c_1 c_2
\cdots
\]
so that
\begin{eqnarray*}
A & = & a_2 a_1 a_0 \ . \ b_0 b_1 \\
B & = & c_0 c_1 c_2
\end{eqnarray*}
(Choosing specific lengths for $A$ and $B$ cuts down on the number of
``ellipsis dots'' we need to denote the numeral, as in ``$123 123
\cdots 123 \cdots$'', hence enhances legibility.)

If we now invoke the evaluation rules of (\ref{eq:real-numeral-number}),
we find that
\begin{eqnarray}
\nonumber
r & = &
\mbox{\sc value}(a_2 a_1 a_0 \ . \ b_0 b_1 \
c_0 c_1 c_2 \
c_0 c_1 c_2
\cdots
c_0 c_1 c_2
\cdots) \\
\nonumber
  & = &
\mbox{\sc value}(a_2 a_1 a_0)
 \ + \ \mbox{\sc value}(b_0 b_1) \cdot b^{-2}
 \ + \
\mbox{\sc value}(c_0 c_1 c_2) \cdot b^{-5} \\
\label{eq:sum-in-numeral}
  &  &
 \ + \
\mbox{\sc value}(c_0 c_1 c_2) \cdot b^{-8}
 \ + \
\mbox{\sc value}(\gamma_0 \gamma_1 \gamma_2) \cdot b^{-11}
\ + \cdots \\
\nonumber
  & = &
\mbox{\sc value}(a_2 a_1 a_0)
 \ + \ \mbox{\sc value}(b_0 b_1) \cdot b^{-2}
 \ + \
\mbox{\sc value}(c_0 c_1 c_2) \cdot \sum_{i=1}^\infty b^{-2-3i}
\end{eqnarray}

{\Denis We must change VALUE, is corresponds to $NUM_{10}$ right?}

We shall learn in Section~\ref{sec:geometric-sums} that infinite
summations such as the one in (\ref{eq:sum-in-numeral}), namely,
$\sum_{i=1}^\infty b^{-2-3i}$,
{\em converge}---meaning that {\em they have finite rational
  sums}---and we learn how to compute these sums.  For the purposes of
the current proof, we just take this fact on faith, and we denote the
summation's finite rational sum by $p/q$.

Collecting all of this information, we find that there exist {\em
  integers} $m$, $n$, $p$, and $q$ such that
\[ r \ = \ m \ + \ n/ b^{2} \ + \ p/q \ = \
\frac{mqb^2 + nq + p}{qb^2}. \]
The number $r$ is, thus, the ratio of two integers; hence, by
definition, it is rational.

\item 
{\small\sf Part 2: the `` only if'' clause.}

Say next that the real number $r$ is rational---specifically,
\[ r \ = \ s + \frac{t}{q} \]
for nonnegative integers $t < q$ and $s$.  It is only the fraction
$t/q < 1$ that can produce an infinite numeral, so it suffices for us
to verify the special case
\[ r \ = \ \frac{t}{q} \ < \ 1 \]
of the proposition.

We prove that $r = t/q$ has an ultimately periodic infinite numeral by
using \index{synthetic division} {\it synthetic division}---the
algorithm taught in elementary school---to compute the ratio $t/q$.
As we proceed, keep in mind that we are working in base $b$.  Each of
the following successive divisions produces one digit to the right of
the radix point, in addition to a possible {\it remainder} $r_i$ from
the set $\{0, 1, \ldots, q-1\}$.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:build-rational-numeral}
\begin{array}{lclc|l|cc}
\multicolumn{3}{c}{\mbox{Division step}} & &  \hspace*{.15in} \mbox{Current numeral} & &
\mbox{Current remainder} \\
\hline
b \cdot t   & = & a_0 \cdot q \ + \ r_0 &
      & t/q \ = \ .a_0 \cdots &
      & r_0 < q \\
b \cdot r_0 & = & a_1 \cdot q \ + \ r_1 &
      & t/q \ = \ .a_0 a_1 \cdots &
      & r_1 < q \\
            & \vdots &  & & \hspace*{.3in} \vdots &  & \vdots \\
b \cdot r_i & = & a_{i+1} \cdot q \ + \ r_{i+1} &
      & t/q \ = \ .a_0 a_1 \cdots a_{i+1} \cdots &
      & r_{i+1} < q \\
b \cdot r_{i+1} & = & a_{i+2} \cdot q \ + \ r_{i+2} &
      & t/q \ = \ .a_0 a_1 \cdots a_{i+1} a_{i+2} \cdots &
      & r_{i+2} < q \\
            & \vdots &  & &  \hspace*{.3in}\vdots & & \vdots   \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Because of the possible values the remainders $r_j$ can assume, no
more than $q$ of the divisions in the (infinite) system
(\ref{eq:build-rational-numeral}) are distinct.  ({\em This is an
  application of the pigeonhole principle
  (Section~\ref{sec:pigeonhole}).})  Because of the way the system
proceeds, once we have encountered two remainders, say, $r_i$ and
$r_{i+k}$, that are equal---i.e., $r_i = r_{i+k}$---we must
thenceforth observe periodic behavior:
\[
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
r_i       & = & r_{i+k}    & = & r_{i+2k}   & = & r_{i+3k}   & = \ \cdots \\
r_{i+1}   & = & r_{i+k+1}  & = & r_{i+2k+1} & = & r_{i+3k+1} & = \ \cdots \\
\vdots    &   & \vdots     &   & \vdots     &   & \vdots     & \\
r_{i+k-1} & = & r_{i+2k-1} & = & r_{i+3k-1} & = & r_{i+4k-1} & = \ \cdots \\
\end{array}
\]
This will engender periodicity in the digits of $r$'s base-$b$ numeral:
\[ [\mbox{\sc initial segment}]
 [a_i a_{i+1} \cdots a_{i+k-1}]
          [a_i a_{i+1} \cdots a_{i+k-1}]
    \cdots  [a_i a_{i+1} \cdots a_{i+k-1}] \cdots 
\]
We are, thus, observing the claimed ultimately periodic behavior in
$r$'s base-$b$ numeral.
\end{enumerate}
\qed
\end{proof}

\bigskip

We end this section by illustrating the process of generating numerals
for rationals via synthetic division.  We employ the fraction $t/q = 4/7$
and base $b = 10$.
\[
\begin{array}{lclc|l|cc}
\multicolumn{3}{c}{\mbox{Division step}} & &  \hspace*{.15in} \mbox{Current numeral} & &
\mbox{Current remainder} \\
\hline
10 \cdot 4   & = & 5 \cdot 7 \ + \ 5 &
      & 4/7 \ = \ .5 \cdots &
      & 5 \\
10 \cdot 5 & = & 7 \cdot 7 \ + \ 1 &
      & 4/7 \ = \ .57 \cdots &
      & 1 \\
10 \cdot 1 & = & 1 \cdot 7 \ + \ 3 &
      & 4/7 \ = \ .571 \cdots &
      & 3 \\
10 \cdot 3 & = & 4 \cdot 7 \ + \ 2 &
      & 4/7 \ = \ .5714 \cdots &
      & 2 \\
10 \cdot 2 & = & 2 \cdot 7 \ + \ 6 &
      & 4/7 \ = \ .57142 \cdots &
      & 6 \\
10 \cdot 6 & = & 8 \cdot 7 \ + \ 4 &
      & 4/7 \ = \ .571428 \cdots &
      & 4 \\
 & \vdots & & & \vdots & & \vdots
\end{array}
\]
The remainder $4$ in the last illustrated division step cycles us back
to the initial division step, where the ``$4$'' came from the
numerator of the target fraction.  This repetition signals that the
entire process cycles from this point on.  In other words, we have
determined that
\[ \frac{4}{7} \ = \ .[571428] \ [571428] \ [571428] \ \cdots \]

\bigskip

Propositions~\ref{thm:integer-real} and~\ref{thm:rational-real} show
us that the three sets of numbers we have defined are a nested
progression of successively more inclusive sets, in the sense that
{\em every integer is a rational number} and {\em every rational
  number is a real number}.  Those interested in the (philosophical)
foundations of mathematics might quibble about the verb ``is'' in the
highlighted sentences, but for all practical purposes, we can accept
the sentences as written.



\subsection{Scientific Notation}
\label{sec:scientific-notation}
\index{Scientific notation}

There is a familiar game in which one is challenged to guess how many
beans there are in a jar. The wild ranges of guesses that players make
indicate eloquently what is one of the main starting points in the
popular-science book {\it Innumeracy} \cite{Paulos}: While we ``know''
a lot about even {\em very} large numbers and {\em very} small
numbers, we often lack {\em operational} command of the numbers.  This
fact can be illustrated in at least two ways.

\noindent {\bf 1.}
The ability to compare the magnitudes of big numbers:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Can you compare the probabilities of a person's being hit by lightning
(say, in Mexico City) or by a car (say, crossing Fifth Avenue in Times
Square)?
\item
Do you know whether you have more hairs on your body than there are
grains of sand on the beach at Ipanema, Brazil?
\item

Do you know whether there were more Homo Sapiens alive on December 31,
1999, than had lived from the Big Bang to December 31, 1945?
\item
Can you compare the number of rhinoviruses that can populate a square
of side-length $1$mm with the number of stars visible on a clear night
at the summit of Mount Everest?
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf 2.}
The ability to delineate ``how much information'' a number tells us:
Many of us know---or can calculate---that (in some sense) the distance
between Earth and its closest star, the Sun, is, very roughly,
\[ \begin{array}{rl}
93,000,000 & \mbox{ miles} \\
148,800,000 & \mbox{ km} \\
491,040,000,000 & \mbox{ feet} \\
5,892,480,000,000 & \mbox{ inches}
\end{array}
\]

{\Denis notice here that people in US need 3 different non-correlated metrics 
while from the french revolution and "systeme metrique" we need only one (the meter)...}

All of these numbers are coarse approximations.  In some sense, they
all convey exactly the same information, since all are obtained from
the first number (the number of miles to the Sun) by simple scaling.
Yet, while the first number projects a modest two (decimal) digits of
accuracy, the others project, respectively, four digits, five digits,
and six digits.  Do all of these numbers convey the same (level of)
truth?

\medskip

Scientists and pedagogues and philosophers have grappled with the
problems engendered by innumeracy throughout time; see, e.g.,
Footnote~\ref{foot:Pascal}.  One ingenious approach within the domain
of astronomy has been to establish a new standard unit of distance to
express the {\em very} large distances from Earth to stars beyond our
solar system: A {\em light year} is the distance that light travels in
an Earth-year, roughly $9.4607 \times 10^{12}$ km.  By using this
measure, one can describe enormous (well, astronomical) numbers
without unwarranted appearances of inflated accuracy.  The notion of
light year plays an important role for astronomy, but it does not port
gracefully to other domains, for two reasons: (1) The use of the speed
of light as a frame of reference has no meaning when one is, for
instance counting grains of sand or numbers of viruses.  (2) The
scaling factor inherent in a light year is not appropriate for other
domains.  The widely accepted general alternative to a new scaling
unit is {\em scientific notation}.  \index{scientific notation}

Within scientific notation, one specifies an arbitrary number, of
arbitrary magnitude via a {\em rational approximation} of the form
\[ . \beta_0 \beta_1 \beta_2 \cdots \beta_{a-1} \times b^s \]
The interpretation is that
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\beta_0 \beta_1 \beta_2 \cdots \beta_{a-1}$ represents the $a$
  base-$b$ {\em digits of accuracy} that are warranted by the accuracy
  of one's level of knowledge about the number being specified.

\item
$b^s$ is the base-$b$ {\em scaling factor} that adjust the digits of
  accuracy relative to the radix point.
\end{itemize}
Within this system of specification, we thus have
\[ \begin{array}{lcll}
.93    & \times & 10^8     & \mbox{ miles from Earth to the Sun} \\
.94607 & \times & 10^{13}  & \mbox{ kilometers traveled by light in an Earth-year} \\
.31415 & \times & 10       & \mbox{ value of $\pi$ to $5$ digits of accuracy} \\
.166   & \times & 10^{-23} & \mbox{ grams of weight of a proton, to $3$ digits of accuracy}
\end{array}
\]


{\Denis I suggest to add a section on numbering systems (we already spoke about binary system,
I would like to add a section on Fibonacci numbering system), 
I put it in the following, but may be we will have to put somewhere else, or as an exercice?}

\section{Fibonacci Number Systems}
\label{sec:Fibo-numbers}

We study how Fibonacci numbers can be used as a basis for representing any integers.

Let us first introduce a useful notation: $j \gg k$ iff $j \geq k+2$.

We will first prove the \textit{Zeckendorf's theorem} which states that every positive integer $n$ has a unique representation of the form:

$n = F(k_1) + F(k_2) + ... + F(k_r)$ where $k_1 \gg k_2 \gg ... \gg k_r$ and $k_r \geq 2$.

Here, we assume that the Fibonacci sequence starts at index $1$ and not $0$,
moreover, the decompositions will never consider $F(1)$ (since $F(1)=F(2$)). 
For instance, the representation of $12345$ turns out to be:

$12345 = 10946 + 987 + 377 + 34 + 1 = F(21) + F(16) + F(14) + F(9) + F(2)$
\bigskip

Figure~\ref{zeckendorf} shows the decomposition of the first 26 integers written in this system. 
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{../FIGmaths/zeckendorf_representations.png}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{FiguresArithmetic/Zeckendorf}
        \caption{The first integers (on the Y-axis) broken down into the Zeckendorf representation.
        The shaded rows corresponds to pure Fibonacci numbers.}
\label{zeckendorf}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Proof of Zeckendorf's Theorem}

The proof is done by induction on $n$ for proving simultaneously both construction and uniqueness.

\begin{itemize}
\item
The basis is true since the decomposition is obviously unique for $n=2$ (and also for $n=3$). 
Notice that for $n=4$, we have $4 = 3 + 1 = F(4) + F(2)$. 

\item
Assume for the induction step that any integer strictly lower than $F(k)$ can be decomposed uniquely as the sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
We will prove as a consequence that an integer $n$ in the next interval between two consecutive Fibonacci numbers $F(k) \leq n < F(k+1)$ may be decomposed. 

If $n=F(k)$ is a Fibonacci number, the decomposition is reduced to $F(k)$.

Moreover, it is not difficult to check that it is unique.

%by using Property~\ref{prop:FiboSum}:
%$F(k) = 2+ \sum_{i=1}^{k-2} F(i)$ (the 2 comes from the shift of the starting element of the sequence...).

\medskip

If $n \neq F(k)$ write $n = F(k) + N$.

As $N$ is strictly lower than $F(k)$, we apply the recurrence hypothesis to decompose it into non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers:

$n = F(k) + F(k_1) + F(k_2) + \cdots + F(r)$ where $k_2 \gg ... \gg k_r \geq 2$. 

The last point to verify is that $F(k)$ and $F(k_1)$ are not consecutive ($F(k) \gg F(k_1)$), which is done by contradiction:

Assuming $k$ and $k_1$ are consecutive ($k_1=k-1$) leads to $n = F(k+1) + F(k_2) + \cdots + F(r)$
which contradicts $n < F(k+1)$.
\end{itemize}

Any unique system of representation is a numbering system.

The previous theorem ensures that any non-negative integer can be written
as a sequence of bits $b_i$, in other words,

$n = (b_mb_{m-1}...b_2)_F$ iff $n = \Sigma_{k=2}^m b_k F_k$.

Let us compare this system to the binary representation.
For instance, the Fibonacci representation of $12345$ is $(100001010000100000010)_F$
while  $12345 = 2^{13} + 2^{12} + 2^{5} + 2^{4} + 2^{3} + 2^{0} = (1100000111001)_2$.

The binary representation is more compact. 
\bigskip

The decomposition in the Fibonacci basis of the first integers (starting from $1 = (00001)_F$) is as follows:

 $2 = (0010)_2 = F_3 = (00010)_F$
 
 $3 = (0011)_2 = F_4 = (00100)_F$
  
 $4 = (100)_2 = 3+1 = (00101)_F$
 
 $5 = (101)_2 = F_5 = (01000)_F$
 
 $6 = (110)_2 = 5+1 = (01001)_F$
 
 $7 = (111)_2 = 5+2 = (01010)_F$
 
 $8 = (1000)_2 = F_6 = (10000)_F$
 
 $9 = (1001)_2 = (10001)_F$
 
 $10 = (1010)_2 = (10010)_F$
 
 $11 = (1011)_2 = (10100)_F$
 
 $12 = (1100)_2 = (10101)_F$
 
 $13 = (1101)_2 = F_7 =(100000)_F$
 
 ...
 
There is no consecutive digits equal to $1$ in such representations.
