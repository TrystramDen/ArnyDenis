John Arburthnot in {\it Of the Laws of Chance}, 1692

Colorful polymath, mid 17th century -- early 18th cent.

... where a Mathematical reasoning can be had, it's as great folly to
make use of any other, as to grope for a thing in a dark, when you
have a candle standing by you.

Isaac Newton in letter to Robert Hooke (15 February 1676)

If I have seen further it is by standing on ye [the] sholders of Giants.
