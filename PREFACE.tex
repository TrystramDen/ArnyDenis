\chapter*{Preface}

We live in a world of increasing professional and social diversity.  Computing curricula have responded to these changes by dramatically changing focus and scope.

\smallskip

Early computation-oriented academic programs focused narrowly on the principles and practices related to designing and using digital computers.  Discrete mathematics was ``automatically'' prepended to such programs, in recognition of the fact that every aspect of the design and use of computers built upon mathematical concepts and tools.  Today, these traditional programs have been joined by a broad range of curricula which focus on the computational concerns of {\em
  consumers} of the craft of computing: scientists or engineers; scholars in the humanities or social studies; practitioners in professions such as business, law, or medicine; \ldots; members of the general population whose computing-related interests are avocational.  Within this new world, many aspiring users of computers need only very specialized knowledge of mathematics in order to compute successfully.  But, the amount and direction of the specialization can vary greatly
based on a student's, or an academic program's, focus; therefore, absent a broad background in mathematics, a student may lack the technical tools necessary to pursue truly bold novel ideas.

\bigskip

The number of nontraditional students seeking technical education is growing, and the ways in which their nontraditional goals and backgrounds manifest themselves is increasing.  We have striven to keep this diversity in mind while writing this text.  We have included a broad range of material, in both subject and level.

\bigskip

Our goal in this book is to endow each reader with an operational understanding of an activity that we---hopefully evocatively---call ``{\em doing}'' mathematics.  We want the reader to be able to recognize situations---especially relating to the world of computing---wherein mathematical reasoning and analysis can make a positive difference.  Of course, a large component of enabling this activity requires imparting mathematical knowledge relating to the fundamental concepts and tools and intellectual artifacts that we have inherited from our mathematical forebears.  Another part, though, requires transmitting the understanding of how to use the knowledge effectively and creatively.

We have striven to design the text so that each chapter adds new computing-related mathematical concepts and techniques to the reader's toolkit.  We have designed each chapter to develop mathematical tools in multiple ways, with the hope that each reader, no matter what her goals, insights, and interests, will learn how to think mathematically and to achieve an {\em operational} understanding of both the activity of computing and the systems that enable that activity.

Our approach toward achieving our goal is embodied in the previous paragraph's promise to develop mathematical tools ``{\em in multiple ways}".
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\em We often present several fundamentally different proofs for the same result.}

\smallskip

\index{The conceptual axiom}
With tongues only mildly impinging on our cheeks, we encapsulate the philosophy underlying this practice in the following ``self-evident truth'', or, ``axiom''.

{\em One's ability to think deeply about a complicated } \\
{\em concept is always enhanced by having more than one way to think about} \\
{\em the concept.}
\end{tabular}

\medskip

An extreme illustration of this stratagem resides in our multiple derivations of the sum of the first $n$ positive integers.  The reader will encounter (in Chapter~\ref{ch:Summation}) derivations that adopt each of the following worldviews:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
View the problem ``textually'', by writing out the summation symbolically and manipulating the resulting string.
  \item
View each positive integer $k$ as a height-$k$ unit-width rectangle.
  \item
View each positive integer $k$ as a collection of $k$ tokens (pebbles) which can be aggregated and manipulated in a variety of ways,
  \item
View the process of summation as a combinatorial object---specifically, the number of ways of selecting $2$ items from a set of $n$ items.
  \item
View the problem geometrically, by drawing a figure and calculating its area.
  \item
View the integers via their familiar names (say, in decimal notation), and calculate their sum by replicating, rearranging, and counting the number of occurrences of different numbers.
  \end{enumerate}
While the number of derivations of this result exceeds our norm, the {\em fact} of exploiting multiple viewpoints is a hallmark of our approach.

\item
{\em We organize discrete mathematical topics in conceptual layers.}

\smallskip

Our treatment of the fundamental topic ``number'' illustrates this stratagem well.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
We describe the number system that we have inherited from our mathematical forebears in Chapter~\ref{ch:numbers-numerals}.  The treatment in this chapter is mostly discursive but it is peppered with a number of important results and computational insights.
  \item
In Chapter~\ref{ch:numbers-advanced}, we take a more careful look inside our number system, addressing topics such as prime numbers---and their use within encoding schemes and security.  In order to do justice to this deeper layer of material, we insert Chapters~\ref{ch:arithmetic} and~\ref{ch:Summation}, which cover arithmetic and summations, respectively, between
Chapters~\ref{ch:numbers-numerals} and~\ref{ch:numbers-advanced}.
  \item
Finally, we turn in Chapter~\ref{ch:numerals} to the issue of how we represent numbers in order to compute with them.  Here again, we insert auxiliary material---in this case, Chapter~\ref{ch:Recurrences}, which covers recurrences---between number-oriented chapters, to lay the groundwork for material related to systems of number representation.
  \end{enumerate}

%{\Denis why only the following chapters? I suggest to add few words about the basic materials -- chapters 3 sets and their algebra, chapter 4 arithmetic, the status of chapter 5 is more ambiguous, not really basic material, targeting summations that are a fundamental material for estimating the cost of algorithms.  Another remark, the list starts by chapter 10 (the last one...)}
\item
{\em We continually point out mathematical insights into {\em computing-related} concepts, tools, and systems.}

\smallskip

While this book is unquestionably a text on {\em mathematics}, we never lose sight of the computational motivation for our work.  Traces of this motivation are visible, for instance, in:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
Chapters~\ref{ch:numbers-numerals},~\ref{ch:numbers-advanced}, and~\ref{ch:numerals}, where we develop material concerning numbers and their representations that underlies much of the world of computing:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item
how to efficiently encode complicated structures as integers

\smallskip

There are applications to security and cryptography lurking in this subject.
     \item
how numbers and numerals can model {\em self-referentiality} in languages

\smallskip

The consequences of self-referentiality abound throughout philosophy, linguistics, and the foundations of computing.  The property leaves its mark on computing-related topics ranging from programming languages and compilers to the inherent complexity of broad families of computations.
     \item
how to design an adder that does not expend time ``rippling carries''

\smallskip

This is basically an engineering-oriented concern, but its resolution involves important mathematical ideas.
     \end{itemize}
  \item
Chapter~\ref{ch:Recurrences}, where we discuss in detail material about recurrences that is of crucial importance in the design and analysis of algorithms
  \item
Chapters~\ref{ch:Graphs1} and~\ref{ch:Graphs2}, where we discuss aspects of graphs and networks that are particularly relevant to topics such as:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item
social networks
     \item
the interconnection networks of parallel computer architectures
     \item
the design of integrated electronic circuits
     \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\item
{\em We sprinkle stories into the text, in the hope of inspiring the reader, while stimulating mathematical thinking and understanding.}

\smallskip

As we remarked at the end of our {\it Manifesto}, mathematics is done---created, analyzed, applied---by humans.  It is both inspiring and illuminating to realize the variety of backgrounds, goals, and motivations that our mathematical forebears had.  The digressions also provide momentary diversions to help the reader approach the ensuing material reinvigorated.

\item
{\em We present a number of short, informal introductory essays on advanced topics.}

\smallskip

We expect that much of this material will go beyond the level of mathematical achievement that most readers will start out with.  We hope that the citations we provide to accompany these essays will inspire further reading, and often even further mathematical exploration.
