\noindent{{\large\em  Addition} \hfill { Roger Trystram, 1973}}

\begin{dedication}
To my beloved wife, Susan, and my children Paul and Rachel for decades of patience during my extended episodes of ``cerebral absence.''

\smallskip

\noindent
To Professor Oscar Zariski, who changed my life by introducing me to ``real" mathematics.

\bigskip

\noindent
With love to my wife C\'ecile and my children Alice and No\'e who help me to stay connected to the ``real'' world.
\smallskip

\noindent To all past students who inspired this book.

\noindent To all future students who will read this book.
\end{dedication}
