\section{Why Is This Book {\em Needed?}}
\label{sec:bookneeded}

How much mathematics does an aspiring computing professional
need---and at what level of expertise?  We beleve that the answer to
this pedagogically fundamental question is time dependent.

\medskip

\noindent {\it The early generation}.
In the early days of computing, all aspects of the field were
considered the domain of the ``techies''---the engineers and
scientists and mathematicians who designed the early computers and
figured out how to use them to solve a range of (mostly
compute-intensive) problems.  Back then, one expected every computing
professional to have a mastery of many mathematical topics.

\medskip

\noindent {\it Children of the early generation}.
Times---and the field of computing---changed.  The ``techies'' were
able to craft a variety of sophisticated tools that opened up the
world of computing to the general population.  Even people at the
lower levels of the educational edifice were able to use imagination
and ingenuity, rather than theorems and formulas, to produce
impressive software artifacts of considerable utility.

\medskip

\noindent {\it The modern generation}.
Pendulums were made to swing.  As we note in our {\it Manifesto}, we
now encounter almost daily problems that arise from unanticipated
concomitants of the often unstructured ingenuity that produced various
software artifacts.  Many would say that we need a renewed commitment
to technical discipline that will endow artifacts with
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\em understandable structure}, so that we can determine {\em what} went
wrong when something {\em does} go wrong.
\item
{\em sustainability}, so that changes, which are inevitable in complex
artifacts, will not create new problems
\item
{\em controllability}, so that ``smart'' artifacts do not become
modern instances of Dr.~Frankenstein's monster.
\end{itemize}
While we certainly need not return to the era of the ``techies'', it
is unquestionable that we do need a larger contingent of computing
professionals who have bona fide expertise that enables the needed
technical discipline.  This text is devoted to the mathematics that
underlies the needed science and engineering.

\bigskip

Of course, there are many introductory texts on discrete mathematics.
What separates this text from the others is the stratagem we have
implemented to accommodate our intended audience of aspiring computing
professionals.  The skeleton of this stratagem appears in the {\it
  Preface}.  We expand on it in the next section.



\section{Why Is {\em This} Book Needed?}
\label{sec:thisbookneed}

We live in a world of increasing professional and social diversity.

\medskip

Classical computing curricula began as highly technically-oriented
studies leading to a degree such as a BS, within a school of science
or engineering.  The evolution of the computing field have occasioned
changes in this curricular worldview.  The traditional curricula have
been joined by curricula that have deemphasized the traditional
science and engineering and mathematics courses, in order to emphasize
the humanities or social studies (leading, say, to a BA degree), or to
emphasize the {\em practice} of computing, either in a general setting
(leading, say, to a degree in IT) or in a focused applied field
(leading, say, to a degree in business or finance or law or \ldots).
Within this new world, many aspiring computer professionals arguably
need only specialized knowledge of mathematics---but the amount and
direction of the specialization can vary greatly based on an academic
program's focus.

\medskip

Add to the preceding reality the phenomenal broadening of the audience
for technical curricula, hence for some level of mathematics
education.  Many barriers to such education have now either
disappeared or at least diminished in impact.

\medskip

The number of nontraditional students seeking technical education is
growing, and the ways in which their nontraditional goals and
backgrounds manifest themselves is increasing.  This phenomenon is
important to computing educators, who must serve a large population of
students, with quite diverse needs and aspirations.

We have striven to keep this diversity in mind as we have written this
text.  We have included a broad range of material, in both subject and
level.  As noted in the {\it Preface}, we have tried to accommodate
the different backgrounds of our readership, while leading them all to
a level of mathmetical maturity that will enable them to understand
mathematics and to {\em do} mathematics.  As we
discuss a range of mathematical topics for possible inclusion as
prerequisites for the undergraduate study of computing, we try to
indicate why the selected topics are needed.  Readers can then
evaluate which topics are needed for their needs.

\section{The Structure of  This Book}
\label{sec:thisbook}

We categorize our targets in three ways
\begin{enumerate}
\item
{\it Fundamental concepts}

{\small\sf Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item
sets---and their embellishments: tuples, arrays, tables, etc.---as the
embodiment of {\it object}
\item
numbers---and their operational manifestations, numerals---as the
embodiment of {\it quantity}
\item
graphs---in their many, varied, forms---as the embodiment of {\it
  connectivity} and {\it relationship}
\item
algebras---adding operations to sets, numbers, and graphs---as the
embodiment of {\it structured dynamism} and {\it computing}
\end{itemize}

\item
{\it Fundamental representations}

{\small\sf Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item
viewing numbers via the metaphors of: slices of pie, tokens arranged in
stylized ways, rectangles of varying dimensions
\item
using grouping and/or replication to represent relationships among
objects
\item
viewing interrelated objects via varying structures: tables, tuples,
graphs, geometric drawing
\end{itemize}

\item
{\it Fundamental tools/techniques}

{\small\sf Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item
using induction to expand from simple examples to complex ones
\item
using integration to approximate summation, and vice versa, to
(mentally) ``hop'' between the discrete and continuous worlds
\item
using the conceptual tools of asymptotics to argue qualitatively about
quantitative phenomena.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
