\chapter{$\oplus$ Pointers to Advanced Topics on Graphs}
\label{ch:advanced-topics}

%**PROVIDE SOME REFERENCES

We conclude this chapter by mentioning a variety of topics that are typically not covered---at least in depth---early in the curriculum, but that are important enough that the reader should at least be aware of them.  The topics we choose are motivated by studies in virtually every computational area that benefits from graph-theoretic models.  We have tried to present each topic at a level of discourse that will prepare the interested reader to delve more deeply into the material, yet at a level of informality that will make the material accessible to the more casual reader.  We thus strive for an intuitive presentation that will not lead any reader astray.

\index{graph!graph separators}\index{graph!graph decomposition}

Section~\ref{sec:graph-decompose} focuses on the myriad computations on graphs that can be accomplished efficiently via recursive algorithms that (1) decompose an input graph $\g$; (2) process the resulting subgraphs of $\g$; (3) reassemble the processed graphs.

\medskip

\index{graph!evolving graphs} \index{graph models within social media}

Section~\ref{sec:graph-evolve}  introduces the increasingly important topic of graphs whose structure changes dynamically over time.  One timely instance of such dynamic evolution is the connectivity graph of the Internet.

\medskip

\index{hypergraphs} \index{graph!hypergraphs} \index{VLSI} \index{bus-orinted communication}

Section~\ref{sec:hypergraphs} introduces {\it hypergraphs}, a generalization of graphs that allows relationships among {\em multiple} entities/vertices, in contrast to the purely {\em binary} relationships demanded by graphs' {\em two-element} edges.  Hypergraph-based models find application in areas as diverse as:
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\it social networks:} Hyperedges can describe, e.g., collaboration and collusion.
\item
{\it electronic networks:} Hyperedges can enable the design of equi-potential vertices in 
voltage-driven technologies such as {\it VLSI}.
\item
{\it communication networks:} Hyperedges can model bus-oriented communication.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\index{graph!multigraphs} \index{multigraphs}

Section~\ref{sec:multigraphs} introduces {\it multigraphs}, a generalization of graphs that allows a graph to have multiple edges connecting each pair of vertices.  In contrast to our other graph-generalizations, multigraphs are used more {\em internally}, as an algorithmic device, than {\em externally}, as an abstraction that models features of ``real'' structures.  In particular, multigraphs can replace an edge with weight $c \in \N^+$ by $c$ unweighted edges with the same endpoints.  Such distinct-yet-equivalent options can trigger algorithmic ideas.

\noindent
The reader will certainly have noted that some ``named'' graphs are, intuitively, more tightly interconnected than others---with the cycle and clique being the antipodal examples.  Even from a purely intellectual vantage point---and all the more so from an algorithmic vantage point---it would be of interest to be able to quantify the tightness of a graph's interconnectedness.  Among  the various measures that have been proposed for this task, one stands out for its myriad algorithmic implications: the notion of {\it graph separator}.  In fact, this notion appears in the literature in several flavors.  An $n$-vertex, $e$-edge graph $\g$ has:
\begin{itemize}
\item
an {\it $\alpha$-edge separator} of size $k$---where $\alpha$ is a real number with $\alpha \leq 1/2$  and $k$ is an integer with $k < n$---precisely if:

\index{graph!$\alpha$-edge separator of size $k$}

\smallskip

one can partition $\g$ into two disjoint (not-necessarily connected) subgraphs, each having 
$\leq \alpha n$ vertices, by removing $\leq k$ edges from $\g$.

\item
a {\it $\alpha$-vertex separator} of size $\ell$, where $\alpha$ is a real number with  $\alpha \leq 1/2$ and $\ell$ is an integer with $k < e$, precisely if:

\index{graph!$\alpha$-vertex separator of size $\ell$}

\smallskip

one can partition $\g$ into two disjoint (not-necessarily connected) subgraphs, each having
$\leq \alpha n$ vertices, by removing $\leq \ell$ vertices from $\g$.
\end{itemize}
We replace the term ``separator'' with the term {\em ``bisector''} if both subgraphs after a separation operation have $\leq \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} n \right\rfloor$ vertices.

\index{graph!edge bisector} \index{graph!vertex bisector}

\medskip

Commonalities and differences in graphs' inherent separator sizes are often not visually obvious.  For illustration, referring to the ``named'' graphs of Section~\ref{sec:graphs-important-families}:
\begin{itemize}
\item
It is certainly obvious that cycles are easier to bisect than cliques, as measured by either edge or vertex bisectors.
\item
It is far less clear that de Bruijn networks and hypercubes are roughly equal in ease of bisection, as measured by vertex bisectors.
\end{itemize}

\smallskip

Similarity in separation behavior often has very important algorithmic consequences.  For instance, the closeness in separation characteristics between de Bruijn networks and hypercubes manifests itself in a large range of algorithmic applications.  The range of such applications is hinted at by sources that study the algorithmics of laying out VLSI circuits (e.g., [Leiserson, 1985]) and sources that study the ability of a network's interconnections to host a range of communication patterns that enable efficient parallel computation and communication (e.g., [ Annexstein, Baumslag, and Rosenberg, 1990], [Leiserson, 1985], and [ Ullman, 1984].

\medskip

There is a large literature that develops the algorithmics of finding small separators for computationally significant families of graphs.  An early star in the firmament of such studies is the discovery in [Lipton, Tarjan, 1979] of a $1/3$-vertex separator of size $\sqrt{8n}$ for $n$-vertex planar graphs.  The dual problem of finding lower bounds on the sizes of graph separators is a bit sparser but, of course, no less significant.  The reader can find a comprehensive exposition on the theory of graph separators in [Rosenberg, Heath, 2001], including both the mathematics that yields lower bounds on separator sizes and the algorithmics that yields upper bounds.

\bigskip

A large variety of problems in the area of graph algorithms involve graphs---especially 
trees---whose structures evolve over time.  Such evolution is observed, e.g., in the study of ``classical" algorithmic problems such as {\it Minimum Spanning Tree} and {\it Branch and Bound}; see, e.g., \cite{CLRS}.  What is certain to be more exciting to the reader, though, are the ``modern'' topics where one encounters graphs with evolving structure, such as {\it social networks} and {\it inter-networks} (e.g., the {\it Internet of Things}).

\smallskip

For ``classical'' topics, as exemplified by the two we have mentioned, the mathematics covered in this chapter will provide the reader with the background necessary to deal with graph evolution.  Indeed, this evolution emerges as an inevitable concomitant of the algorithmics that is superimposed upon the traditional structures of graph theory: the challenge to the reader is to assimilate new algorithmic notions, not new mathematics.

\medskip

\index{graph!with evolving structure!social networks}
\index{graph!with evolving structure!inter-networks}

In contrast, the ``modern'' topics we have mentioned do require the assimilation of new 
mathematics.  Dealing successfully with the algorithmic issues that arise with social networks and inter-networks requires the reader to understand the structures of the evolving graph-oriented systems and how evolution changes these structures.  Among the interesting (and valuable) mathematical questions that one can pose is: If you are a new vertex ``applying" to join an evolving network, which vertex in the network is the best one to connect to, in order to best facilitate your interactions or influence within the community.  The latter topic leads, e.g., to the study of {\em power-law} networks.

\bigskip

\noindent \fbox{
\begin{minipage}{0.96\textwidth}
An evolving network {\it obeys a power law} if there exists a real number $\gamma >0$with the following property.  For all network vertices having sufficiently large vertex-degrees, the fraction of vertices in the network that have degree $k$ is proportional to $k^{-\gamma}$.
\end{minipage}
}
\bigskip

Little of the abstract work on power-law networks would likely be studied in depth in any early course; indeed, the structure of these networks is not yet well understood even in advanced settings.  Indeed, attempts to understand power laws with rigor have given rise to a number of competing, rather sophisticated, abstract models---see, e.g.,  [Aiello, Chung, Lu, 2000], [Barab\'{a}si, Albert, 1999], [Bollobas, 1985], and [Chen, Chang, Govindan, Jamin, Shenker, Willinger, 2002]---and numerous studies have attempted to understand the specific situations wherein the abstract models reflect reality more or less faithfully---see, e.g.,
[Bu, Towsley, 2002], [Faloutsos, Faloutsos, Faloutsos, 1999], [Jaiswal, Rosenberg, Towsley, 2004] [Tangmunarunkit, Govindan, Jamin, Shenker, Willinger, 2002], and [Zegura, Calvert, Donohoo, 1997].

\bigskip

\noindent \fbox{\begin{minipage}{0.96\textwidth}
We have just cited several sources that deal with the evolving formal notion of power-law graph.  This apparent overkill---wouldn't one citation suffice?---is intentional.

\smallskip

As new ``real-life" concepts emerge which need mathematical modeling---in this case, as the social media become an object of increasing study---there is inevitably a period in which competing mathematical models are proposed.  All of the models that have emerged thus far capture the central feature of power laws, as presented in the message box that precedes this one.  But every mathematical model embodies ``side" features that go beyond the targeted central feature.  We must allow multiple models to coexist until we have the opportunity to compare all of the models' side features.  Only after this vetting period will the scientific community converge on a single mathematical model of a ``real-life" concept such as ``power-law graph".

\bigskip

\noindent
A large variety of modern computing-related topics benefit from the structure inherent in graph-theoretic models but do not comfortably conform to the {\em binary} relationships imposed by graphs' having {\em two} vertices per edge.  A model that retains the general structure of graph-theoretic models while it abandons the {\em binary} constraint in edge-membership is the generalization of graphs called {\em hypergraphs}.  A hypergraph has vertices that play exactly the same role as with graphs, but in place of a graph's $2$-element edges, a hypergraph has {\em hyperedges}, each being a set of vertices whose size is not restricted to $2$.  A rather general treatment of hypergraphs can be found in the comprehensive graph-theory text such as \cite{Berge73}; a specialized article that focuses on hypergraph-related versions of several topics from this chapter, such as vertex-coloring, is [Lovasz, 1973].

\smallskip

Because of their inherent conceptual complexity, hypergraphs as graph-theoretic objects are usually relegated to advanced courses.  However, the literature contains many studies of hypergraphs that are ``fine-tuned'' for specific computing-related applications.  Many of these studies should be accessible without extensive mathematical background.  Sample  computing-related applications that benefit from hypergraph-oriented models include the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Bus-connected parallel communication has been part of digital-computer design since its earliest days.  The informal picture of such a system is that there are communication channels which multiple agents can retrieve messages from and post messages to.  In hypergraph-oriented terms: the vertices/communicating agents aggregate into groups/hyperedges.  Each group's agents share ``read/write'' access to a specific channel.  A specialized genre of hypergraph that was invented to study the described scenario is the {\it interval hypergraph} model developed in [Rosenberg, 1989].
\index{hypergraph!modeling bus-connected communication}
\index{hypergraph!interval hyergraph}

\item
Modern electronic circuits are implemented using integrated circuit technology, specifically, {\em VLSI: Very Large Scale Integrated circuitry}; the often-informal book [Mead, Conway, 1979] provides an introduction to VLSI for the non-specialist.  VLSI technologies are often {\em voltage}-driven, rather than {\em current}-driven.  Accordingly, much of the attention when designing VLSI circuits centers on the coordination of equi-potential points in an electrical  network, rather than on point-to-point transmission of signals.  Hypergraphs are tailor-made for such technologies.

A crucially important issue that arises because of the design strengths and weaknesses of VLSI 
technology is {\it fault tolerance}---how to cope with the inevitable faulty transistors in massive VLSI systems.  A variety of quite-accessible mathematical ideas can provide provocative ideas about this important topic; see, e.g., [Rosenberg, 1985].

\item
Social networks have become so prevalent in society that no one will be surprised to learn that many approaches to modeling the networks' interconnectivity have been studied.  In
Section~\ref{sec:graph-evolve}, we discussed an interconnectivity model based on evolving graphs and clustering within such graphs.  More recently, hypergraph-based models have also been proposed; see, e.g., [Amato, di Lillo, Moscato, Picariello, Sperl, 2017] and [Liu, Blenn, Van Mieghem, 2010].

\section{Multigraphs and the Chinese Postman Problem}
\label{sec:multigraphs}
\index{graph!multigraph} \index{multigraph}

A {\it multigraph} is a graph-like structure that admits a {\em multiset} of edges, rather than a set.  In detail, a multigraph $\h$ has a set $\n_{\fh}$ of vertices and a {\em multiset} of edges, each edge being a $2$-element set of vertices.  Viewed differently, a pair of vertices in a multigraph can be connected by more than one edge.  Fig.~\ref{fig:EulerianFinal} depicts a $10$-vertex multigraph
having $3$ multi-edges.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FiguresGraph/EulerienFinal}
       \caption{A $10$-vertex multigraph with $3$ multi-edges.}
              \label{fig:EulerianFinal}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\smallskip

We noted as we introduced this section's extensions to graphs that multgraphs were often used as an algorithmic tool rather than as a modeling tool.  We present a sample algorithmic use of multigraphs that allows us to extend the concept of Eulerian tour to a family of graphs that lie outside the domain established by Proposition~\ref{thm:eulerian-cycle}


\bigskip

Proposition~\ref{thm:eulerian-cycle} completely settles the ``pure'' version of the Euler-tour problem for {\em graphs}.  We learn from that result that a graph $\g$ admits a tour that crosses each edge precisely once if, and only if, every vertex $v \in \n_{\fg}$ has even degree.

\medskip

From an applied vantage point, pragmatism is often preferable to purity!  When one does not have access to an efficient solution for the ``pure'' version of a practically important problem, because some essential precondition is violated, then one is often willing to ``bend the rules" if such ``distortion" will give one access to an efficient solution to the resulting ``not-quite-pure'' version of the problem. 

\medskip

The preceding dictum can be illustrated via the Euler-tour problem.
\begin{description}
\item
{\em If a {\em connected} graph $\g$ has an {\em even number of odd-degree vertices}, then we can augment $\g$ by adding new edges, so that $\g$ becomes a {\em multigraph} $\g^+$ that admits a tour which crosses every edge precisely once.}
\end{description}
In fact, we can solve this ``distorted" version of the Euler-tour in a manner that is algorithmically efficient in the following senses.
\begin{itemize}
\item
{\em The newly added edges preserve the neighbor relation of $\g$.}

\smallskip

In other words, as we add the new edges that convert $\g$'s edge-set to an edge-{\em multiset}, we never create new adjacencies: Every new edge that we add connects vertices that were already connected in $\g$.

\item
{\em The algorithm adds the fewest number of new edges possible in order to achieve the described tour.}

\smallskip

In other words, if $\g'$ is a multigraph produced by adding edges to $\g$, and if $\g'$ has fewer edges than $\g^+$, then $\g'$ does {\em not} admit a tour which crosses each edge precisely once.
\item
{\em The algorithm is computationally efficient: it operates in time polynomial in the size of the graph $\g$.}
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\index{Route Inspection Problem} \index{Chinese Postman Problem} \index{Kwan Mei-Ko}

Our ``distorted" version of the Euler-tour problem is actually a well-known combinatorial optimization problem which is known either as the {\it Route Inspection Problem} or as the {\it Chinese Postman Problem}---the latter name in honor of the Chinese mathematician Kwan Mei-Ko who invented the problem.\footnote{M.-K.~Kwan (1960): Graphic programming using odd or even points.  {\it Acta Mathematica Sinica, 10} (in Chinese), 263--266.  Translated into English in {\it Chinese Mathematics 1} (1962) 273--277.}  These colorful names arise from stories about a person---either a route inspector or a postal employee---who must traverse all of the roads in a village and who wants to avoid extraneous road traversals.

\medskip

We illustrate the problem and an algorithm that solves it.

\smallskip

Fig.~\ref{fig:EulerianInitial} presents a $10$-vertex input $\g$ to our ``distorted" Euler-tour problem. 
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FiguresGraph/EulerienInitial}
       \caption{A $10$-vertex graph which is not Eulerian.}
              \label{fig:EulerianInitial}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Note that $\g$ is not Eulerian because it has four odd-degree vertices---happily, an even number.  $\g$'s odd-degree vertices are highlighted in Fig.~\ref{fig:EulerianVodd}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FiguresGraph/EulerianVodd}
       \caption{$\g$ with its $4$ odd-degree vertices highlighted.}
              \label{fig:EulerianVodd}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\smallskip

We sketch a process that adds a minimally many edges to $\g$ while converting $\g$ to a multigraph which admits a ``distorted" Euler tour. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Record, for each pair of vertices $u, v \in \n_{\fg}$, the length $\ell(u,v)$ of a {\em shortest path} between $u$ and $v$.  (Recall that $\g$ is connected.)

\smallskip

Computing each length $\ell(u,v)$, together with a length-$\ell(u,v)$ path between $u$ and $v$, can be accomplished in low-degree polynomial time; see \cite{CLRS}.

\item
Say that $\g$ has $m$ odd-degree vertices $w_1, \ldots, w_m$ ($m=4$ in our illustration).  Create a copy of the $m$-clique $\k_m$ on these $m$ vertices.

\item
Label each edge $\{u,v\}$ of the clique $\k_m$ with the path-length $\ell(u,v)$.

\item
Compute a perfect matching of minimal weight in the edge-weighted clique $\k_m$.

\smallskip

Computing minimal-weight perfect matchings can be accomplished in low-degree polynomial time; see \cite{CLRS}.

\smallskip

Fig.~\ref{fig:Eulerianperfectmatching} illustrates the results of this process on our sample graph $\g$.   {\em Note}: The double-edges that we add make the degrees of all odd-degree vertices even.  The double-edge at the top of $\g$ in the drawing makes the degrees of both top vertices even; the length-$2$ double-edge at the bottom of $\g$ in the drawing makes the degrees of both bottom odd-degree vertices even.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FiguresGraph/EulerienPerfectMatching}
       \caption{A minimum weight perfect matching labelled by the shortest-distances $\ell(u,v)$.}
              \label{fig:Eulerianperfectmatching}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item
Replace each weighted edge produced by the process by an appropriate number of multi-edges.

\smallskip

Fig.~\ref{fig:EulerianFinal} performs this last step for the weighted graph of Fig.~\ref{fig:Eulerianperfectmatching}.
\end{enumerate}

\smallskip

Our augmented multigraph $\g^+$ now has all even vertex-degrees.  We can, therefore, adapt the Euler-tour algorithm from the proof of Proposition~\ref{thm:eulerian-cycle}(a) to produce a tour of $\g^+$ that crosses each multi-edge precisely once.  The required adaptation simply views distinct multi-edges as distinct edges for the purposes of the mandate to ``leave a vertex by a different edge than you entered on".

\medskip

The importance of the notion of multigraph in this story is that it gave us a perspicuous bridge between the strongly algorithmic world of edge-weighted graphs and the purely graph-theoretic world that underlies Proposition~\ref{thm:eulerian-cycle}.
