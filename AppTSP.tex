\index{Traveling Salesman Problem}

In Section~\ref{sec:Hamiltonian-unweighted}, we suggested how daunting
it is computationally to determine whether an unweighted graph admits
a Hamiltonian cycle.  There is an important, practically significant,
analogue of this problem for edge-weighted graphs, which has
traditionally been known as the {\it Traveling Salesman Problem}; we
shall use the modern abbreviation {\it TSP}.
\index{Traveling Salesman Problem}
\index{TSP: the Traveling Salesman Problem}
The TSP is a classical problem in Operations Research, whose familiar
name arises from the following story.
\index{Traveling Salesman Problem!origin of the name}

We consider a saleswoman who wants to make a call on all of her $n$
clients, who live in the $n$ cities, $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n$.  In
order to minimize the {\it cost} of her tour, she studies the
$\displaystyle {n \choose 2}$ real numbers $\{c_{i,j} \ | \ 1 \leq i,j
\leq n\}$, where each $c_{i,j}$ is the {\it cost} of traveling between
cities $C_i$ and $C_j$ (in either direction).  
\bigskip

\noindent \fbox{
\begin{minipage}{0.95\textwidth}
We are purposely vague about the meaning of the word ``cost'' here.
The costs represented by the unknowns $c_{i,j}$ could be intercity
driving distances or inter-region travel times or international
airfares.  Instances of the TSP can be formulated with {\em any}
notion of cost that can be represented by positive real numbers.

\smallskip

The importance of being vague is that, in particular, {\em none of
  these costs is assumed to obey any of the laws that one commonly
  associates with the distances we encounter in our daily lives}.  The
{\it triangle inequality} is a prime example of such a law.
\index{triangle inequality} Intuitively, this law insists that the
distance between any two cities is never decreased by placing an
intermediate stopover city between them.  It is a discretization of
the geometric postulate, {\em A straight line is the shortest distance
  between two points.}  Cost measures that obey the triangle
inequality are termed {\it Euclidean} \index{Euclidean distance
  measure} \index{Euclid} because the distances studied in Euclidean
geometry are assumed to obey this law.

\smallskip

Some people like to think of general intercity costs as
airfares---which clearly obey no immutable laws.)
\end{minipage}
}
\bigskip

The saleswoman's objective is to schedule the order of visiting her
clients' $n$ cities in the most economical way.  Formally, the
challenge of the TSP is to discover a minimum-cost tour of all $n$
cities.  Such a tour would be a cycle of the form
\[ C_{i_1} \ - \ C_{i_2} \ - \cdots - \ C_{i_n} \ - \ C_{i_1} \]
such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item
all $n$ cities appear in the tour precisely once;
\item
no tour has cost smaller than the cost
\[ c_{i_1,i_2} \ + \ c_{i_2, i_3} \ + \cdots + \  
c_{i_{n-1}, i_n} \ + \ c_{i_n, i_1} \]
of the indicated tour.
\end{itemize}
The main connection of the TSP to the current chapter is twofold.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The TSP can be represented as a weighted analogue of the problem of
detecting Hamiltonian cycles.  Within this representation, the TSP's
$n$ cities are depicted as an instance of the complete graph $\k_n$,
and its intercity costs are real-number weights on the edges of
$\k_n$.  We describe this representation via the following informal,
but precise, encoding of a graph $\g$ as an instance of the TSP.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
Each node of $\g$ becomes a ``city'' that must be visited.
  \item
For each pair of cities/nodes $A$ and $B$:
\[ \mbox{\sc cost}(A,B) \ = \ \left\{
\begin{array}{ccl}
1 & & \mbox{if there is an edge between $A$ and $B$ in $\g$} \\
\infty & & \mbox{if there is no edge between $A$ and $B$ in $\g$} \\
       & & \mbox{\small\sf (if the idea of ``infinite'' cost bothers
  you, then} \\
       & & \mbox{\small\sf make this some ridiculousy large number)}
\end{array}
\right.
\]
{\Denis Attention notations are not consistent between COST and $c_{i,j}$}
  \end{itemize}

\item
The TSP is computationally ``no easier'' than the
Hamiltonianicity-detection problem, in a very strong sense.  By
definition, the target of the TSP is a tour of minimum {\em overall
  cost}, as measured by the sum of the costs of the edges traversed in
the tour.  But, of course, {\em every} tour has some cost, according
to this measure.  The computational difficulty of the TSP is suggested
by the following result, which we state without proof.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{prop}[\cite{GareyJ79}]
\label{thm:Approx-TSP-NPC}
For any fixed positive constant $\kappa$, the problem of finding a
tour for an instance of the TSP that is within a factor of $\kappa$ of
minimal is an {\sf NP}-complete problem.
\end{prop}


The fact that TSP is a computationally complex problem is not very
surprising, because the TSP can be framed in a way that encompasses a
form of the Hamiltonianicity-detection problem.
What {\em is} surprising, though, is that if we restrict attention to
{\em Euclidean} instances of the TSP---i.e., instances whose ``costs''
measure Euclidean \index{Euclidean TSP problem} distances---say,
driving distances---then there exists a rather efficient algorithm
that solves such instances of the TSP {\em approximately} optimally,
\index{Traveling Salesman Problem!approximately optimal solution}
\index{TSP: the Traveling Salesman Problem!approximately optimal solution} 
in the sense of Proposition~\ref{thm:Approx-TSP-NPC}.  That is, there
exists a fixed constant $\kappa > 0$ such that, for each Euclidean
instance $\i$ of the TSP, if an {\em optimal}---i.e., {\em
  cost-minimal}---tour for instance $\i$ has cost $c^\star$, then the
cost of the tour discovered by the algorithm is no larger than $\kappa
\cdot c^\star$.  The algorithm that achieves this approximation is
named for its inventor, Nicos Christofides.
\index{Christofides, Nicos}

\ignore{*********
It corresponds to determine a minimal Hamiltonian cycle in a weighted
complete graphs $K_n$.  Obviously, $K_n$ is Hamiltonian (it exists
$n!$ such Hamiltonian paths), thus, the question here is to determine
the minimum one.

  Of course, she must go in every city and her objective is to
minimize the total distance done in the tour.  The only information
she has is the list of the cities and a map with all inter-cities
distances.  We assume a \textit{Euclidian distance} (for instance the
weights correspond to number of kilometers between two cities).  This
property means that the straight line is always the minimum distance,
or in other words that the distance between two vertices/cities is
larger if the path is going through any other vertex.
%More formally, the input of the problem is a weighted matrix with an infinite weight on the diagonal.
\bigskip
*****************}

\begin{prop}[\cite{Christofides76}]
There exists an algorithm for the Euclidean TSP that produces
approximately optimal tours, specifically, tours whose costs are no
greater than $1.5$ times the cost of an optimal tour.
\end{prop}

Proving this result is the domain of an algorithms text such as
\cite{CLRS}.  We remark only that the algorithm combines a number of
classical computational problems that admit efficient solutions:
minimum-weight spanning trees, preorder walks within trees, and
minimum-weight perfect matchings.

\bigskip
We construct an efficient solution for the Euclidean TSP, which is
known as {\it the Christofides algorithm}, \index{Christofides algorithm} 
after its inventor, Nicos Christofides.

an instance of the Euclidian TSP with $n=7$ cities.

Let us construct a good solution (not \textit{too far} from the optimal) in polynomial time. 
Let us denote by $\omega_G$ the weight of graph G (i.e. the sum of the weights on its edges). 
The Christofides algorithm proceeds in three steps. 
\bigskip

\textbf{Step 1.} Determine a minimal weight spanning tree $T^*$. 
%A spanning tree of G is a tree (connected graph with no cycle) with the same set of vertices as G. 
As we recalled in the preliminaries, a minimal weight spanning tree can be determined in polynomial time. 
\bigskip

$\omega_{T^*}$ is a lower bound of the value of the optimal tour $\omega_{H^*}$. 
Indeed, $H^*$ is a cycle, then, removing any edge in $H^*$ leads to a chain, which is a particular spanning tree.
As $T^*$ is the minimal spanning tree, we have:
$\omega_{T^*} \leq \omega_{H^*}$.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{FiguresGraph/christofides2}
       \caption{Construction of an optimal spanning Tree $T^*$.}
              \label{fig:christofidesSpanningTree}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Step 2.} Consider now the set $V_{odd}$ of the vertices of $T^*$ whose degrees are odd. 

We proved in the preliminary properties that the cardinality of $V_{odd}$ is even. 

Let us construct the perfect matching $C^*$ of minimum weight between the vertices in $V_{odd}$. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:AllPerfectMatchings} shows all possible perfect matchings on the previous example, the optimal one (with minimal weight) is represented in bold. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:christofidesPerfectMatching} illustrates the graph obtained by considering the edges of both $T^*$ and $C^*$. 
\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{FiguresGraph/christofides3}
       \caption{Adding the optimal perfect matching $C^*$ to the minimal spanning tree $T^*$.}
              \label{fig:christofidesPerfectMatching}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Let us now determine a lower bound of the optimal tour $H^*$ (represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:perfectMatchingInitial}).

$2 \omega_{C^*}$ is a lower bound of the value of the optimal tour ($\omega_{C^*} \leq \frac{1}{2} \omega_{H^*}$). 
Indeed, consider first the perfect matching $C^*$.
As its vertices belong to $H^*$, $\omega_{C*}$ is lower than the piece of Hamiltonian tour contained between these vertices
because of the euclidian property (see Fig.~\ref{fig:perfectMatchingC*}).
Similarly for the \textit{complementary} perfect matching $C$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:perfectMatchingC}).  
Thus, the weight of the cycle formed by the concatenation of both perfect matchings 
is lower than the Hamiltonian tour $\omega_{C^* \bigcup C} \leq \omega_{H^*}$.
Moreover, as $C^*$ is the minimum perfect matching, we have $\omega_{C^*} \leq \omega_{C}$, 
this concludes the proof.

       \caption{Cycle $C^* \bigcup C$ (in dashed and bold).}
              \label{fig:perfectMatchingC}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\bigskip

\textbf{Step 3.} 
All the vertices of $T^* \cup C^*$ have an even degree since we added an edge of $C^*$ to every odd degree vertices of $T^*$. 
We are now going to transform this graph by replacing iteratively the high degree vertices by shortcuts, 
which decreases the degree until reaching $2$. 

While it exists a vertex of degree greater than 4, we remove two of these consecutive edges and replace them 
by the opposite edge of this triangle 
without disconnecting the graph. 
There are $2k$ ways to remove $2$ edges and replace them by the triangle edge. 
Some of them disconnect the graph and thus, must be avoided. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:christofidesFinalStep1} shows such a transformation on the previous example, 
Fig.~\ref{fig:christofidesFinalStep2} shows a valid transformation.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{FiguresGraph/christofides4}
       \caption{Reduction of the degree in $T^* \bigcup C^*$, disconnected solution.}
              \label{fig:christofidesFinalStep1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
       \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{FiguresGraph/christofides5}
       \caption{Reduction of the degree in $T^* \bigcup C^*$, connected solution.}
       \label{fig:christofidesFinalStep2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

This process leads to a feasible tour. 
Such transformations do not increase the total weight.

Finally, 
as $\omega_{T^*} \leq \omega_{H^*}$ and $\omega_{C^*} \leq 1/2 \omega_{H^*}$,
we deduce that the value of such a tour is lower than $3/2 \omega_{H^*}$.
