\section{$\oplus$ A fun result dealing with divisibility}

Chapter 4 or alternatively chapter 10.

This exercice was a favorite question by the famous mathematician Paul Erdos, 
he often used it to test the ability of young students in mathematics...

The problem is described as follows: Let consider the 2n first integers.

Take any $n+1$ integers in this set and prove that there exists a pair $(p,q)$ such that $p$ divides $q$.
\smallskip

Hint : Write the $2n$ numbers by decomposing the sequence into multiples of powers of 2. 
When there are multiple ways, we take the one with the largest power of 2 in order to make the decomposition unique. 

Example for n = 7:
$(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13)$, 
$(2, 6, 10, 14)$,
$(4, 12)$ and $(8)$.

Thus, according to such a decomposition, all the integers of the sequence are written as: 

$2k \times m$ where $m$ is odd.
Use the pigeon hole principle to exhibit $p$ and $q$.

\section{The Horner-Estrin scheme for polynomial evaluation}

Chapter 5

Notice that the analysis leads asymptotically to the same complexity as the classical Horner's scheme but in a different way.
\bigskip

Let consider a polynomial of degree $d$:
\[
P(x) \ \ = \ \ a_0 \ + \ a_1 x \ + \ a_2 x^2 \ + \cdots + \ a_{d-1} x^{d-1} \ + \ a_d x^d
\]

Below is an example for $d=7$.

We rewrite $P(x)$ as:
\[
P(x) \ \ = \ \ a_0 \ + \ a_1 x \ + \ x^2 \ ( a_2  \ + a_3 x \ ) \ + 
\ x^4 \ ( \ a_4 \ + \ a_5 x \ + \ x^2 \ ( a_6  \ + a_7 x \ ) \ )
\]

%\noindent General degree $d$:
%
%$P(x) \ \ = \ \ a_0 \ + \ x \cdot (a_1 \ + \ x \cdot (a_2  \ +  \cdots
%+ x \cdot (a_{d-2} \ + \ x \cdot (a_{d-1} \ + \ a_d x)) \cdots ))$  

We introduce 

$C_i^{(0)} = a_i + x a_{i+1}$ 

$C_i^{(n)} = C_i^{(n-1)} + x^{2n} C_{i+2^n}^{(n-1)}$ 
\bigskip

Write $P(d)$ using the $C_i$ (consider $d$ is a power of $2$ to simplify).

How many additions and multiplications are required?
\bigskip

Solution:
\[
P(x) \ \ = \ \ C_{0}^{(0)} \ + \ x^2 \ C_2^{(0)} \ + 
\ x^4 \ ( \ C_4^{(0)} \ + \ x^2 \ C_6^{(0} \ )
\ = \ C_0^{(1)} \ + \ x^4 \ C_4^{(1)} 
\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
For $d=7$, we have $2$ multiplications for computing $x^2$ and $x^4$
\item
Then, 4 multiplications for the products $a_7 x$,  $a_5 x$, $a_3 x$ and $a_1 x$

followed by 4 additions
\item
2 multiplications for the $x^2 C_2^{(0)}$ and  $x^2 C_6^{(0)}$

followed by 2 additions
\item
Finally, 1 multiplication for computing $x^4 C_4^{(1)}$

followed by 1 addition
\end{itemize}

Total of $2 + 7$ multiplications and $7$ additions.

Generalization: 
$d + log_2(d)$ multiplications and $d$ additions.
\bigskip

This has to be compared to the Horner's scheme: $d$ multiplications and $d$ additions.

\section{Product of $4$ consecutive integers}

Chapter 2 or chapter 6

Show that the product of $4$ consecutive integers $P(k) = k.(k+1).(k+2).(k+3)$
is a multiple of $4!$
\bigskip

Solution.

Two methods are possible here, one is purely arithmetic and the other one is geometric.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The result directly follows from the following facts:

In $4$ consecutive integers, at least two are even, one of both even is a multiple of $4$.
In $3$ consecutive integers, at least one in a multiple of $3$.
\item
The geometric construction is tricky and comes from a representation of the product $P(k)$ as a rectangle whose sides are the product of the two extreme factors 
$k.(k+3)$ by the two internal factors $(k+1)(k+2)$.

$k.(k+3) = k^2 + 3k$ and $(k+1)(k+2) = k^2 + 3k +2$, thus, $P(k)$ is almost a square (a square minus 1)
if the last column is put as the last rows as shown in the figure.

We can even go further since the elementary pattern is a triangular number which is divisible by $3$:

The side of this square
$k^2+3k+1$ is odd. 

$\Delta_{3k-1} = \frac{3k.(3k-1)}{2}$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercise}

Let consider a suite of triangles that contain smaller size equilateral $(1,1,1)$ triangles. 
The objective here is to enumerate all equilateral triangles for each index of the progression
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:countingTriangles}).
The goal is to compute the elements of the progression.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FiguresArithmetic/CountingTriangles} 
        \caption{The first three triangles of the progression.}
        \label{fig:countingTriangles}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The first terms of the progression are $1$ and $5$ ($4$ small triangles and a large one).

Compute this number for the third term.

Draw the fourth term and compute its number.

Solution.

Let denote the k-th term by $N_k$.

$N_1=1$, $N_2=4$ (one large and 4 small triangles) and $N_3=13$ (1 large, 3 medium and 9 small ones).
\\

Hint: Let do an enumeration is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$N_3 = 10$
\item 
$N_4 = 27$.

Fig.~\ref{fig:countingTriangles2} and Fig.~\ref{fig:countingTriangles3}
provides a clear enumeration (from small to large triangles).
\end{enumerate}

Notice that the number of the smallest triangles at rank $k$ corresponds to the sum of odds
which is equal to $k^2$ (according to the result proved in chapter Summation).
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{FiguresArithmetic/CountingTriangles2} 
        \caption{7 triangles at level 2 triangles (4 + 3).}
        \label{fig:countingTriangles2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{FiguresArithmetic/CountingTriangles3} 
        \caption{3 triangles at level 3.}
        \label{fig:countingTriangles3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\bigskip

The solution is:

$N_k = \frac{k.(k+2).(2k+1)}{8}$ for $k$ even

$N_k = \frac{k.(k+2).(2k+1)-1}{8}$ for $k$ odd
\bigskip

The expressions can be derived by the following trick:
Make the difference between two consecutive numbers and again and again, then, the pattern is obvious
(alternance of $2$ and $1$, ...). See Fig.~\ref{fig:countingTrianglesproof}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{FiguresArithmetic/CountingTrianglesProof} 
        \caption{Computing the differences of consecutive $N_k$.}
        \label{fig:countingTrianglesProof}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
\bigskip

Still, the solution is not obvious.

Consider the last two lines.
The problem is determining a closed expression for the sequence is rather easy:

$2 \rightarrow 6$

$4 \rightarrow 9$

$6 \rightarrow 12$

$8 \rightarrow 15$

$f_1(k) = 3.(\frac{k}{2}+1)$

$f_2(k) = f_1(k) - 2$, thus $f_2(k) = \frac{3}{2}(k+1)+1$

\section{A special type of permutation: the Monge's shuffle}

A card trick: the Shuffle of Monge.
\bigskip

We are given 2n cards, which are divided evenly into two decks. 
The shuffle corresponds to put them such that the cards in the final deck come alternatively from left to right as depicted 
in Fig~\ref{fig:suffleMonge}.
The order $(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)$ becomes $(5,1,6,2,7,3,8,4)$.
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{FiguresArithmetic/suffleMonge} 
        \caption{Shuffle for $8$ cards ($n=4$).}
        \label{fig:suffleMonge}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


Let consider a prime $p$ $53$ and an integer $n$ such that $2n+1=p$.
Here $n=26$, $2n=52$ is a usual deck of Poker cards. 

We apply this shuffle several times.

Show that the number of steps of Monge shuffle to come back to the initial deck divides $p-1$. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Exercise}

Let consider the sum of the $n$ first integers $\Delta_n$.

Show the following expression:
for any positive integer $n$,
\[ \Delta_{n}^2 \ = \ n^3 + \Delta_{n-1}^2 \]

The solution is easy by decomposing $\Delta_{n} = n + \Delta_{n-1}$
and then, developing the square $\Delta_{n}^2 = n^2 + 2.\Delta_{n-1} + \Delta_{n-1}^2$


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Exercise}

Prove that 
\[ \Delta_{n} + \Delta_{n-1} \ = \ n^2  \]

The solution is straightforward by any method
(arithmetic manipulations, Fubini double counting principle, geometrical, recurrences, etc.).

we can ask for several proofs, the goal is then to master the big variety of proofs...
\bigskip

Another related expression is to ask for a "similar" expression for:
\[ \Theta_{n} + \Theta_{n-1} \ = \ ?  \]

where $\Theta_n$ is the sum of the $n$ first $\Delta_n$.

The goal here is to guess a mathematical property, and then, to prove it.

$\Theta_{n} + \Theta_{n-1} $ is equal to the sum of the first $n$ squares, which is equal to $\Delta_n^2$.

\section{Fast multiplication of polynomials}


\subsection{Case study for degree 1}

Let consider $P(x) = a_1 + a_2 x $ and $P'(x) = a'_1 + a'_2 x $

$(P \times P')(x) = (a_1.a'_1) + (a_1.a'_2 + a_2.a'_1) x + (a_2.a'_2) x^2$

The coefficients of this new polynomial require $4$ multiplications and $1$ addition, 
namely $a_1.a'_1$, $a_1.a'_2$, $a_2.a'_1$ and $a_2.a'_2$.
\bigskip

Show how to reduce the number of multiplications using the Karatsuba's trick 
introduced in Exercise~\ref{} that is, 
to use the following arithmetic identity $ad+bc = ac + bd + (b-a)(c-d)$.

\subsection{1 star - Extension}

The goal now is to extend the previous analysis to polynomial of higher degrees.
Let consider that the degree is a power of $2$.
\bigskip

Solution:
Let detail what happens for polynomials of degree $2$:

Let consider $P(x) = a_1 + a_2 x + a_3 x^2$ and $P'(x) = a'_1 + a'_2 x + a'_3 x^2$

$(P \times P')(x) = (a_1.a'_1) + (a_1.a'_2 + a_2.a'_1) x + (a_1.a'_3 + a_2.a'_2 + a_3.a'_1) x^2 + (a_2.a'_3 + a_3.a'_2) x^3 +  (a_3.a'_3) x^4$
\bigskip

Now, write $P(x) = A_1 + A_2 x^2$ 

where $A_1 = a_1 + a_2 x$ and $A_2 = a_3$ and similarly for $P'$

$(P \times P')(x) = (A_1.A'_1) + (A_1.A'_2 + A_2.A'_1) x^2 + (A_2.A'_2) x^4$ 

and apply the same method as before using again the Karatsuba's trick on the $A_i$ and $A'_i$.
